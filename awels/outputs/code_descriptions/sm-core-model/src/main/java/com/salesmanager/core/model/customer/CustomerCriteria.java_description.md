# CustomerCriteria.java

## Review

## 1. Summary
- **Purpose**: `CustomerCriteria` is a data‑transfer object (DTO) that encapsulates filtering criteria used when querying customer data (e.g., by name, email, or country).  
- **Key Components**:
  - Extends `com.salesmanager.core.model.common.Criteria` – a base class that likely provides paging, sorting, or other generic query parameters.
  - Five simple properties (`firstName`, `lastName`, `name`, `email`, `country`) with standard getter/setter pairs.
- **Design Patterns / Frameworks**:  
  - Uses the *JavaBean* convention for property access (private fields with public getters/setters).  
  - No advanced patterns; it is essentially a plain POJO used for criteria passing.

## 2. Detailed Description
The class resides in `com.salesmanager.core.model.customer` and is intended to be populated (manually or by a framework such as Spring MVC) with user‑supplied search parameters.  
At runtime, a service layer will likely accept an instance of `CustomerCriteria` and translate it into a database query (JPA, Hibernate, MyBatis, etc.). Because it extends `Criteria`, it inherits common pagination or sorting properties, making it reusable across various query contexts.

**Execution Flow** (conceptual):
1. **Initialization**: An instance is created by the calling code (controller, service, or test).  
2. **Population**: The consumer sets desired fields via setters.  
3. **Processing**: A DAO or repository receives the object and uses the non‑null fields to build a dynamic query.  
4. **Cleanup**: No special cleanup is required; the object is short‑lived.

**Assumptions & Constraints**:
- The base `Criteria` class is available and correctly implemented.  
- No validation logic is present; it is assumed that upstream layers validate inputs (e.g., email format).  
- Field names are simple strings; no advanced types (e.g., `Locale`, `Date`) are used.

**Architecture**:
- The DTO follows a **Domain‑Driven Design (DDD)** style: domain objects (`CustomerCriteria`) represent business concepts (search criteria) rather than persistence entities.  
- It promotes separation of concerns: business logic operates on this DTO rather than directly on entity classes.

## 3. Functions/Methods
| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Return | Side Effects |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|--------------|
| `getFirstName()` | Retrieve `firstName` value. | None | `String` | None |
| `setFirstName(String firstName)` | Set `firstName` value. | `String firstName` | `void` | None |
| `getLastName()` | Retrieve `lastName` value. | None | `String` | None |
| `setLastName(String lastName)` | Set `lastName` value. | `String lastName` | `void` | None |
| `getName()` | Retrieve the generic `name` value (could be full name). | None | `String` | None |
| `setName(String name)` | Set the generic `name` value. | `String name` | `void` | None |
| `getEmail()` | Retrieve `email` value. | None | `String` | None |
| `setEmail(String email)` | Set `email` value. | `String email` | `void` | None |
| `getCountry()` | Retrieve `country` value. | None | `String` | None |
| `setCountry(String country)` | Set `country` value. | `String country` | `void` | None |

These are pure accessor methods and do not contain any business logic. They are reusable across any component that needs to expose or consume customer search criteria.

## 4. Dependencies
| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.common.Criteria` | Third‑party (project internal) | Base class for generic query parameters; must be present in the same project/module. |
| Java Standard Library | Standard | Only `String` is used; no external libraries. |

There are no framework-specific annotations (e.g., `@Entity`, `@Component`), so the class is framework‑agnostic.

## 5. Additional Notes
### Strengths
- **Simplicity**: Clear, minimal code makes it easy to understand and maintain.  
- **Extensibility**: Additional criteria can be added by simply adding new fields and their getters/setters.  
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps query parameters separate from domain entities.

### Potential Improvements
1. **Validation**: Adding constraints (e.g., `@Email` for `email`, `@NotBlank` for mandatory fields) would reduce errors upstream.  
2. **Immutability**: Consider using a builder pattern or immutable objects to avoid accidental mutation.  
3. **Documentation**: JavaDoc comments for each field/method would aid developers.  
4. **Equals/HashCode/ToString**: Implementing these methods (or using Lombok annotations like `@Data`) would make debugging and logging easier.

### Edge Cases
- **Null Handling**: The code currently accepts null values; the consumer must decide how to interpret them.  
- **Ambiguous `name` vs. `firstName`/`lastName`**: The presence of both could cause confusion; clarify usage in documentation.

### Future Enhancements
- **Pagination/Sorting**: Relying on the inherited `Criteria` is good, but if additional filters are needed (e.g., date ranges, status), they should be added in a separate subclass to keep concerns clean.  
- **Localization**: If the application supports multiple languages, consider adding a `Locale` field.  
- **Testing**: Unit tests ensuring that getters/setters work correctly and that the object behaves as expected in the repository layer would improve reliability.

Overall, the `CustomerCriteria` class fulfills its role as a simple, clean DTO for customer search parameters. With minor enhancements (validation, documentation, immutability), it can become even more robust and developer‑friendly.

```java
package com.salesmanager.core.model.customer;

import com.salesmanager.core.model.common.Criteria;

public class CustomerCriteria extends Criteria {
	
	private String firstName;
	private String lastName;
	private String name;
	private String email;
	private String country;
	public String getFirstName() {
		return firstName;
	}
	public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
		this.firstName = firstName;
	}
	public String getLastName() {
		return lastName;
	}
	public void setLastName(String lastName) {
		this.lastName = lastName;
	}
	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}
	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
	public String getEmail() {
		return email;
	}
	public void setEmail(String email) {
		this.email = email;
	}
	public String getCountry() {
		return country;
	}
	public void setCountry(String country) {
		this.country = country;
	}

}
