# ShippingSummary.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
**Purpose** – `ShippingSummary` is a simple Java POJO that bundles all the pieces of information required to describe a shipping quote for an order: shipping and handling costs, selected module/option, a few flags (free shipping, tax applicability, whether a quote was generated), and the delivery address.  

**Key components**  
- `BigDecimal` fields for monetary values (`shipping`, `handling`)  
- String fields that reference the shipping provider/module (`shippingModule`), the chosen option (`shippingOption`, `shippingOptionCode`)  
- Boolean flags (`freeShipping`, `taxOnShipping`, `shippingQuote`) that capture shipping status  
- A `Delivery` object (`deliveryAddress`) that holds the recipient’s address  

**Notable patterns/frameworks**  
- Plain old Java object (POJO) pattern – no business logic, only state.  
- Implements `Serializable` (with a `serialVersionUID`) for possible transport or caching scenarios.  
- No external libraries or frameworks are used.

## 2. Detailed Description  
The class is purely a data container. There is no custom constructor; the default no‑arg constructor is used. All fields are mutable, accessed via standard getters and setters.  

1. **Initialization** – A client creates an instance (e.g., by `new ShippingSummary()`) and populates fields through setters, typically after a shipping calculation routine has run.  
2. **Runtime behavior** – The object simply holds the values; no computations are performed inside it. It can be passed between layers (e.g., from a shipping service to the order‑processing layer).  
3. **Cleanup** – None required; the object is GC‑eligible once no references remain.  

### Assumptions & Constraints  
- Monetary values are represented as `BigDecimal`; callers are responsible for scale/precision handling.  
- The flags are independent – the code does not enforce any business rules (e.g., if `freeShipping` is true, `shipping` should be zero).  
- `deliveryAddress` is optional; a null value indicates that no address has been supplied.  
- Since the class implements `Serializable`, it assumes that all fields (including `Delivery`) are serializable or will not be serialized (e.g., transient).

### Architecture & Design Choices  
- **Simplicity** – The POJO approach keeps the domain model lightweight.  
- **Mutability** – Allows easy population but exposes the risk of accidental state changes.  
- **No validation** – The class trusts callers to provide valid data.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Returns | Side‑Effects |
|--------|---------|------------|---------|--------------|
| `getShipping()` | Retrieve shipping cost | – | `BigDecimal` | None |
| `setShipping(BigDecimal)` | Set shipping cost | `shipping` | – | Mutates state |
| `getHandling()` | Retrieve handling cost | – | `BigDecimal` | None |
| `setHandling(BigDecimal)` | Set handling cost | `handling` | – | Mutates state |
| `getShippingModule()` | Get name of shipping module | – | `String` | None |
| `setShippingModule(String)` | Set name of shipping module | `shippingModule` | – | Mutates state |
| `getShippingOption()` | Get selected shipping option | – | `String` | None |
| `setShippingOption(String)` | Set selected shipping option | `shippingOption` | – | Mutates state |
| `isFreeShipping()` | Check if shipping is free | – | `boolean` | None |
| `setFreeShipping(boolean)` | Set free‑shipping flag | `freeShipping` | – | Mutates state |
| `isTaxOnShipping()` | Check if tax applies to shipping | – | `boolean` | None |
| `setTaxOnShipping(boolean)` | Set tax‑on‑shipping flag | `taxOnShipping` | – | Mutates state |
| `getDeliveryAddress()` | Retrieve delivery address | – | `Delivery` | None |
| `setDeliveryAddress(Delivery)` | Set delivery address | `deliveryAddress` | – | Mutates state |
| `getShippingOptionCode()` | Get code of shipping option | – | `String` | None |
| `setShippingOptionCode(String)` | Set code of shipping option | `shippingOptionCode` | – | Mutates state |
| `isShippingQuote()` | Check if a quote has been generated | – | `boolean` | None |
| `setShippingQuote(boolean)` | Set shipping‑quote flag | `shippingQuote` | – | Mutates state |

*All methods are straightforward getters/setters; there are no reusable utility methods beyond this.*

## 4. Dependencies  
| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `java.io.Serializable` | Standard Java | Enables serialization of the object. |
| `java.math.BigDecimal` | Standard Java | Used for precise monetary values. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.common.Delivery` | Project‑specific | Holds address details; assumed serializable. |
| None other | | No third‑party libraries are referenced. |

## 5. Additional Notes & Recommendations  

### Edge Cases  
- **Null monetary values** – `shipping` or `handling` may be `null`; any arithmetic on these will throw `NullPointerException`.  
- **Inconsistent flags** – `freeShipping` true but `shipping` non‑zero.  
- **Incomplete shipping option** – `shippingOption` set but `shippingOptionCode` null (or vice‑versa).  
- **Null `deliveryAddress`** – Some consumers might not guard against this.

### Potential Enhancements  
1. **Immutability** – Provide a constructor that sets all fields, remove setters, and make the class final.  This would prevent accidental mutation once a summary is constructed.  
2. **Validation** – Annotate fields with JSR‑303 (`@NotNull`, `@PositiveOrZero`) and/or add a `validate()` method.  
3. **Convenience Methods** –  
   - `public BigDecimal getTotalCost()` – returns `shipping + handling` (handling nulls).  
   - `public boolean isEligibleForFreeShipping()` – encapsulates the business rule that may involve thresholds.  
4. **Override `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`** – useful for debugging, logging, and collections.  
5. **Use `java.time` for timestamps** – if the summary needs a creation date/time.  
6. **Add Lombok** – to reduce boilerplate (if Lombok is acceptable in the project).  
7. **Documentation & Example** – Inline Javadoc could clarify the meaning of each flag and expected invariants.

### Design Reflection  
The current design serves its purpose as a DTO. However, because shipping rules can evolve (free‑shipping thresholds, tax calculations, new modules), coupling the POJO to business logic would make the system more maintainable. Separating the *value object* (this class) from *service logic* (calculations, rule enforcement) keeps the model clean and testable.
