# MerchantStoreCriteria.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
The file defines a simple Java POJO named **`MerchantStoreCriteria`** that extends a generic `Criteria` base class.  
Its purpose is to capture two boolean flags – `retailers` and `stores` – that can be used to filter or query merchant store data elsewhere in the application.  
The class contains only standard getters and setters, and no business logic or validation.  
No external frameworks are used beyond the project’s own `com.salesmanager.core.model.common.Criteria`.

---

## 2. Detailed Description  
### Core Components  
| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `MerchantStoreCriteria` | Data holder that represents a filter for merchant store queries. |
| `Criteria` (super‑class) | Presumably defines common query parameters such as pagination, sorting, or generic filters. |

### Execution Flow  
1. **Instantiation** – A client creates an instance of `MerchantStoreCriteria`.  
2. **Parameter setting** – The client calls `setRetailers(boolean)` and/or `setStores(boolean)` to specify which store types to include.  
3. **Usage** – The populated object is passed to repository/service layers that interpret the flags and build a query.  
4. **Cleanup** – No explicit cleanup is required; the object is lightweight and relies on garbage collection.

### Assumptions & Dependencies  
- It is assumed that the `Criteria` base class provides necessary context (e.g., paging) for any query.  
- No external libraries are referenced; the only dependency is the internal `Criteria` class.  
- The class follows standard Java Bean conventions, enabling frameworks such as Spring, JPA, or Jackson to introspect properties automatically.

### Design Choices  
- **Explicit flags** – Using two separate boolean fields keeps the API simple but can become unwieldy if more store types are added in the future.  
- **Extending `Criteria`** – Reuse of a common filter abstraction suggests a consistent query pattern across the application.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Description | Parameters | Return | Side Effects |
|--------|-------------|------------|--------|--------------|
| `public boolean isRetailers()` | Getter for the `retailers` flag. | – | `true` if retailers are requested, `false` otherwise. | None |
| `public void setRetailers(boolean retailers)` | Setter for the `retailers` flag. | `retailers` – desired value. | None | Assigns the value to the field. |
| `public boolean isStores()` | Getter for the `stores` flag. | – | `true` if stores are requested, `false` otherwise. | None |
| `public void setStores(boolean stores)` | Setter for the `stores` flag. | `stores` – desired value. | None | Assigns the value to the field. |

> **Note**: No utility or helper methods exist; the class is a plain data container.

## 4. Dependencies  

| Dependency | Type | Remarks |
|------------|------|---------|
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.common.Criteria` | Internal | Provides base filtering functionality. |
| Java Standard Library | Standard | Only the core language constructs are used. |

There are no third‑party libraries, reflection, or platform‑specific APIs involved.

## 5. Additional Notes  

### Strengths  
- **Simplicity** – The class is straightforward, easy to understand, and follows JavaBean conventions.  
- **Extensibility** – By extending `Criteria`, the class can be integrated into existing query pipelines without modification.

### Potential Improvements  
1. **Validation / Invariants**  
   - If a business rule requires that *at least one* of the flags be true, a validation method could be added (e.g., `validate()` that throws an exception or returns a boolean).  
2. **Builder Pattern**  
   - For readability when constructing the criteria, a fluent builder (`MerchantStoreCriteria.builder().retailers(true).stores(false).build()`) would reduce boilerplate and improve immutability.  
3. **Documentation**  
   - Javadoc comments on the class and each method would aid maintainability, especially if the flags have nuanced meanings.  
4. **Enum for Store Types**  
   - If more store categories are anticipated, replacing two booleans with an `EnumSet<StoreType>` (e.g., `RETAILER`, `STORE`) would scale more cleanly.  
5. **Immutability**  
   - Consider making the class immutable to avoid accidental modification after creation.  

### Edge Cases  
- **No Flags Set** – The current design does not prevent a scenario where both flags are `false`, potentially leading to ambiguous query results.  
- **Thread Safety** – As a plain mutable bean, the object is not thread‑safe; concurrent use would require external synchronization.

### Future Enhancements  
- Integrate with a query builder or criteria API (e.g., JPA Criteria API) to automatically convert these flags into predicates.  
- Add unit tests to ensure that flag manipulation behaves as expected.  
- Extend `Criteria` to include pagination or sorting parameters if they are not already present.

---

**Verdict**: The `MerchantStoreCriteria` class is a clean, minimal data holder suitable for basic filtering. For a production codebase, consider the above enhancements to improve robustness, scalability, and maintainability.
