# RentalStatus.java

## Review

## 1. Summary
The file defines a tiny Java `enum` named **`RentalStatus`** inside the `com.salesmanager.core.model.catalog.product` package.  
Its purpose is to represent the rental state of a product – either **`RENTED`** or **`AVAILABLE`**.  
No external frameworks, libraries, or patterns are involved; it is a straightforward domain value object.

---

## 2. Detailed Description
### Core component
- **`RentalStatus`** is an enumeration that holds two constant values:
  - `RENTED`
  - `AVAILABLE`

### Interaction & Usage
- Typically, an instance of `RentalStatus` would be stored as a field in a product or rental entity:
  ```java
  public class Product {
      private RentalStatus rentalStatus;
      // getters / setters
  }
  ```
- The enum can be used in business logic to branch on the current status:
  ```java
  if (product.getRentalStatus() == RentalStatus.RENTED) {
      // prevent further checkout
  }
  ```
- It can also be persisted to a database (e.g., as a string column) via an ORM such as Hibernate, or serialized into JSON when exposed through REST APIs.

### Design considerations
- **Simplicity**: The enum contains only the two status values required by the current business rule set.
- **Extensibility**: Should more rental states (e.g., `RESERVED`, `DEPRECATED`) be required, the enum can be easily expanded without affecting existing code.
- **Type safety**: Using an enum guarantees compile‑time safety compared to raw string constants.

---

## 3. Functions/Methods
The enum contains no explicit methods beyond those implicitly inherited from `java.lang.Enum`.  
Typical implicit methods include:
- `values()` – returns all constants.
- `valueOf(String)` – retrieves a constant by name.
- `name()` – returns the constant’s name.
- `ordinal()` – returns the constant’s position.

No custom utility methods are defined; the enum’s sole responsibility is to represent a value domain.

---

## 4. Dependencies
- **Standard Java library**: No third‑party libraries are referenced.
- **Package context**: Placed under `com.salesmanager.core.model.catalog.product`, implying it belongs to the core domain model of a sales‑manager application.

---

## 5. Additional Notes
### Edge Cases & Limitations
- **No validation**: The enum assumes that any use of the status will be one of the defined constants. If input is deserialized from an external source, you may need to guard against invalid values.
- **No metadata**: If the status needs to carry additional information (e.g., display text, database value, or business rules), consider adding fields or helper methods to the enum.
- **Internationalization**: The string representation is the constant name. If the status is presented to users in UI or reports, map it to a localized string elsewhere.

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Add a description field**:
   ```java
   public enum RentalStatus {
       RENTED("Rented out"),
       AVAILABLE("Available for rent");

       private final String description;
       RentalStatus(String description) { this.description = description; }
       public String getDescription() { return description; }
   }
   ```
2. **Persistability**: Annotate with JPA `@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)` if used with Hibernate.
3. **Utility methods**: e.g., `isActive()` or `isAvailable()` to encapsulate common checks.

### Integration Advice
- **Unit tests**: Verify that each constant is correctly stored and retrieved, especially if persisted or serialized.
- **Documentation**: Update any domain diagrams or documentation to reflect the meaning of each status.

Overall, this enum is clean, minimal, and ready for integration into the larger product catalog module.
