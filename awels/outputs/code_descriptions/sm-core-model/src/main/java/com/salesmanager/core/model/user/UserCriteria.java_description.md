# UserCriteria.java

## Review

## 1. Summary
The `UserCriteria` class is a lightweight data holder that extends a generic `Criteria` base class. It is designed to encapsulate search or filter parameters for querying user records, specifically targeting administrator users.  
**Key components:**
- **Fields**: `adminEmail`, `adminName`, and `active`.
- **Accessors**: Standard getters and setters for each field.
- **Inheritance**: Extends `com.salesmanager.core.model.common.Criteria`, implying that it inherits common pagination, sorting, or filtering features defined there.

The design follows a classic *POJO* (Plain Old Java Object) pattern, suitable for use with data access frameworks such as Hibernate or MyBatis where criteria objects are passed to DAO layers.

## 2. Detailed Description
### Core Components
| Class | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `UserCriteria` | Holds query parameters for admin user searches. |

### Flow of Execution
1. **Creation**: A client (e.g., service or controller) instantiates `UserCriteria`.
2. **Population**: Setters are called to fill in search constraints (`adminEmail`, `adminName`, `active`).
3. **Usage**: The criteria object is passed to a DAO/repository method, which translates its fields into a query (e.g., SQL `WHERE` clauses).
4. **Cleanup**: No explicit cleanup is required; the object is garbage‑collected after use.

### Assumptions & Constraints
- The `Criteria` base class likely provides common pagination (`page`, `size`) and sorting (`sortBy`, `sortOrder`) functionality; however, those aspects are not visible here.
- The `active` flag defaults to `true`, meaning a query without an explicit call to `setActive(false)` will only return active users.
- The class does **not** enforce any validation (e.g., non‑null email), assuming that validation is handled elsewhere (service layer or database constraints).

### Design Choices
- **Simple POJO**: No business logic; purely a data container.
- **Encapsulation**: Fields are private with public getters/setters.
- **Extensibility**: By extending `Criteria`, it inherits additional query capabilities without code duplication.

## 3. Functions/Methods
| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Return | Side Effects |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|--------------|
| `public String getAdminEmail()` | Retrieve the admin email filter. | None | `String` | None |
| `public void setAdminEmail(String adminEmail)` | Set the admin email filter. | `String adminEmail` | `void` | Updates internal state |
| `public boolean isActive()` | Check if the active flag is set. | None | `boolean` | None |
| `public void setActive(boolean active)` | Set the active flag. | `boolean active` | `void` | Updates internal state |
| `public String getAdminName()` | Retrieve the admin name filter. | None | `String` | None |
| `public void setAdminName(String adminName)` | Set the admin name filter. | `String adminName` | `void` | Updates internal state |

*Reusable Utility Methods:* None beyond basic getters/setters; the class is intentionally minimal.

---

## 4. Dependencies
| Dependency | Type | Comments |
|------------|------|----------|
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.common.Criteria` | Project-specific (internal) | Base class providing common query metadata (likely pagination & sorting). |
| `java.lang.String`, `java.lang.Boolean` | Standard JDK | No external libraries required. |

No third‑party frameworks or APIs are referenced directly. The class is platform‑agnostic and can be used in any Java environment.

## 5. Additional Notes
### Edge Cases
- **Null Values**: The class accepts `null` for `adminEmail` and `adminName`. If the DAO expects non‑null values, callers must validate before use.
- **Case Sensitivity**: No handling of case‑insensitive searches; implementation dependent on DAO.
- **Multiple Criteria**: Only three fields are present; adding more filters would require extending the class or using a more dynamic approach (e.g., a `Map<String, Object>`).

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Builder Pattern**: Replace setters with a fluent builder to improve readability (`UserCriteria.builder().adminEmail(...).active(false).build()`).
2. **Validation**: Incorporate basic validation (e.g., email format) via annotations (`@Email`) or custom logic, perhaps using Bean Validation (JSR‑380) if integrated.
3. **Immutability**: Consider making the object immutable once constructed to avoid accidental modifications.
4. **Additional Filters**: Add fields for role, creation date range, etc., to support more complex queries.
5. **Documentation**: Javadoc comments for each method would improve maintainability.

Overall, the class is concise, well‑structured, and serves its purpose as a criteria holder. The main areas for improvement lie in validation, immutability, and documentation.

import com.salesmanager.core.model.common.Criteria;

public class UserCriteria extends Criteria {
	
	private String adminEmail;
	private String adminName;
	private boolean active = true;
	public String getAdminEmail() {
		return adminEmail;
	}
	public void setAdminEmail(String adminEmail) {
		this.adminEmail = adminEmail;
	}
	public boolean isActive() {
		return active;
	}
	public void setActive(boolean active) {
		this.active = active;
	}
	public String getAdminName() {
		return adminName;
	}
	public void setAdminName(String adminName) {
		this.adminName = adminName;
	}

}
