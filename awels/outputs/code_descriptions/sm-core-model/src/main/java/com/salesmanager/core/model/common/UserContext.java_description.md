# UserContext.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
**Purpose** – `UserContext` is a lightweight, per‑thread context holder used to keep request‑specific data (currently just an IP address).  
**Key components**  
* A **static `ThreadLocal<UserContext>`** that guarantees each thread has its own instance.  
* A **factory method `create()`** that sets the current thread’s instance and returns it.  
* Implementation of **`AutoCloseable`** so the context can be cleaned up with a `try‑with‑resources` block.  
* Simple getter/setter for the IP address.  

The design follows the *ThreadLocal* pattern, often called a *Context‑Holder* or *Thread‑Local Singleton*.

---

## 2. Detailed Description  
1. **Initialization** – When a thread needs a context, `UserContext.create()` is called. It constructs a new instance, stores it in the thread‑local variable, and returns the instance.  
2. **Runtime behaviour** –  
   * All subsequent calls in the same thread to `UserContext.getCurrentInstance()` return the same object.  
   * The IP address can be set once the context is created.  
3. **Cleanup** – The `close()` method removes the instance from the thread‑local map. This is essential when threads are reused (e.g., thread pools) to avoid leaking stale data.  
4. **Assumptions / Constraints** –  
   * The caller is responsible for closing the context (ideally via a `try‑with‑resources` block).  
   * No other data besides the IP is stored; adding more fields should follow the same pattern.  
   * The class is **final**, preventing subclassing which preserves thread‑local semantics.  

**Architecture & Design Choices**  
* Using a **ThreadLocal** isolates data per thread without requiring explicit passing around of a context object.  
* Making the class **AutoCloseable** encourages deterministic cleanup.  
* A **static factory** (`create()`) is preferred over a public constructor to enforce the thread‑local contract.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Returns | Side‑Effects |
|--------|---------|------------|---------|--------------|
| `private UserContext()` | Private constructor to prevent direct instantiation. | – | – | – |
| `public static UserContext create()` | Instantiates a new context and binds it to the current thread. | – | `UserContext` | Sets `ThreadLocal` value. |
| `public void close() throws Exception` | Cleans up the thread‑local reference. | – | – | Removes entry from `ThreadLocal`. |
| `public static UserContext getCurrentInstance()` | Retrieves the current thread’s context. | – | `UserContext` (may be `null`) | – |
| `public String getIpAddress()` | Getter for the IP address. | – | `String` | – |
| `public void setIpAddress(String ipAddress)` | Setter for the IP address. | `String` | – | Sets field value. |

**Reusable/Utility Methods** – None beyond the above; the class itself is the utility.

## 4. Dependencies  
| Dependency | Type | Remarks |
|------------|------|---------|
| `java.lang.AutoCloseable` | Standard | Allows `try‑with‑resources`. |
| `java.lang.ThreadLocal` | Standard | Core thread‑local storage. |

No third‑party libraries or external APIs are required.

## 5. Additional Notes  

### Strengths  
* **Simplicity** – The class is small and focused.  
* **Encapsulation** – The context is hidden behind static accessors, preventing accidental misuse.  
* **Deterministic cleanup** – AutoCloseable encourages proper lifecycle handling.

### Potential Issues / Edge Cases  
1. **Forgotten `close()`** – If a thread never closes the context (e.g., a missing `try‑with‑resources`), stale data can leak into subsequent requests processed by the same thread.  
2. **`getCurrentInstance()` may return `null`** – Callers need to guard against this.  
3. **No thread‑pool awareness** – While `close()` removes the reference, there’s no automatic cleanup if the thread dies or the pool shrinks.  
4. **No validation on IP** – An empty or malformed IP string is accepted without error.

### Recommendations & Future Enhancements  
1. **Enforce cleanup** –  
   * Provide a utility method such as `UserContext.runWithContext(Runnable)` that creates, sets, and automatically closes the context.  
   * Document the pattern clearly (e.g., “always use `try (UserContext ctx = UserContext.create()) { … }`”).  

2. **Add more fields** – If more request‑specific data is needed, consider adding them with proper getters/setters or switch to an immutable value object.  

3. **Thread‑Local initialization** – Use `ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> new UserContext())` if you want to lazily create the context and avoid the `create()` step.  

4. **Remove unnecessary `throws Exception`** – `close()` never throws; change signature to `public void close()` for clarity.  

5. **Add Javadoc** – Provide usage examples and explain the importance of calling `close()`.  

6. **Consider using a framework** – If the application already uses Spring, the context could be stored in a `ThreadLocal` bean or a `RequestScope` bean to leverage built‑in lifecycle management.  

7. **Add defensive checks** – Throw an `IllegalStateException` if `create()` is called twice on the same thread without closing the first instance, helping detect programming errors early.  

8. **Unit Tests** – Write tests to verify:  
   * `create()` sets the thread‑local correctly.  
   * `getCurrentInstance()` returns the same instance.  
   * `close()` removes the instance.  
   * No cross‑thread leakage.  

By addressing these points, the class becomes more robust, easier to use correctly, and future‑proof for scaling to larger, multi‑request environments.

```java
package com.salesmanager.core.model.common;

public final class UserContext implements AutoCloseable {
	
	private String ipAddress;
	
	private static ThreadLocal<UserContext> instance = new ThreadLocal<>();

	private UserContext() {}
	
    public static UserContext create() {
    	UserContext context = new UserContext();
        instance.set(context);
        return context;
    }


	@Override
	public void close() throws Exception {
		instance.remove();
	}
	
    public static UserContext getCurrentInstance() {
        return instance.get();
    }

	public String getIpAddress() {
		return ipAddress;
	}

	public void setIpAddress(String ipAddress) {
		this.ipAddress = ipAddress;
	}

}
