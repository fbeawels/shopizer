# PackageDetails.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
`PackageDetails` is a plain Java model (POJO) that represents the attributes of a shipping package. It encapsulates weight, dimensions, quantity, and type information that can be used by shipping, logistics, or inventory modules within the **SalesManager** core domain.  

Key points:  
- **Encapsulation**: All fields are private with public getters/setters.  
- **Domain focus**: The class is intended solely to carry data, with no business logic.  
- **Minimal design**: No frameworks or libraries are referenced; it is a plain Java object.

## 2. Detailed Description  
The class resides in the `com.salesmanager.core.model.shipping` package, suggesting it is part of the core domain layer of a larger e‑commerce platform.  
- **Fields** represent shipping characteristics: `code`, `shippingWeight`, `shippingMaxWeight`, `shippingLength`, `shippingHeight`, `shippingWidth`, `shippingQuantity`, `treshold` (likely a typo for “threshold”), `type` (e.g., “BOX”, “ITEM”), and `itemName`.  
- **Initialization**: The only explicit initialization is the empty string for `itemName`; all other numeric fields default to `0`.  
- **Runtime behavior**: Since the class contains only data, it is typically instantiated, populated, and passed between services or persisted via ORM or serialization.  
- **Cleanup**: No resources are held, so there is no cleanup logic.

### Assumptions & Constraints  
- **Units**: It is assumed that all dimensions and weights are expressed in the same units (e.g., kilograms, centimeters).  
- **Threshold**: The meaning of `treshold` is unclear; it may indicate a threshold weight or quantity but is not documented.  
- **Type field**: The field is a plain string; no enum or validation is applied.  
- **No validation**: Setters accept any value, potentially leading to inconsistent state (negative dimensions, etc.).

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Return | Side‑effects |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|--------------|
| `getItemName()` | Retrieve the package’s item name. | – | `String` | None |
| `setItemName(String)` | Set the item name. | `String` | void | Updates field |
| `getShippingWeight()` | Get current weight. | – | `double` | None |
| `setShippingWeight(double)` | Set weight. | `double` | void | Updates field |
| `getShippingMaxWeight()` | Get maximum allowable weight. | – | `double` | None |
| `setShippingMaxWeight(double)` | Set max weight. | `double` | void | Updates field |
| `getShippingLength()` | Get package length. | – | `double` | None |
| `setShippingLength(double)` | Set length. | `double` | void | Updates field |
| `getShippingHeight()` | Get package height. | – | `double` | None |
| `setShippingHeight(double)` | Set height. | `double` | void | Updates field |
| `getShippingWidth()` | Get package width. | – | `double` | None |
| `setShippingWidth(double)` | Set width. | `double` | void | Updates field |
| `getShippingQuantity()` | Get number of items. | – | `int` | None |
| `setShippingQuantity(int)` | Set quantity. | `int` | void | Updates field |
| `getTreshold()` | Retrieve threshold value. | – | `int` | None |
| `setTreshold(int)` | Set threshold. | `int` | void | Updates field |
| `getCode()` | Retrieve code identifier. | – | `String` | None |
| `setCode(String)` | Set code. | `String` | void | Updates field |
| `getType()` | Retrieve type (e.g., BOX). | – | `String` | None |
| `setType(String)` | Set type. | `String` | void | Updates field |

All methods are simple accessors; no reusable utilities are present.

## 4. Dependencies  
- **None**: The class uses only standard Java types (`String`, `int`, `double`).  
- **No external frameworks**: There are no JPA annotations, validation annotations, or Lombok usage.

## 5. Additional Notes  
### Strengths  
- **Simplicity**: Clear, easy to understand, minimal boilerplate.  
- **Separation of concerns**: Pure data holder, enabling easy serialization or mapping to persistence layers.

### Weaknesses & Edge Cases  
1. **Typo in `treshold`** – Could cause confusion; better to rename to `threshold`.  
2. **No validation** – Negative dimensions or weights can be set, which may break downstream logic.  
3. **String for `type`** – Susceptible to typos; an `enum` would enforce valid values.  
4. **No documentation** – Javadoc or comments explaining each field’s purpose would aid maintainability.  
5. **Immutability** – Current design is mutable; immutable objects can be safer in concurrent contexts.  

### Recommendations for Future Enhancements  
- **Rename `treshold` to `threshold`** and update all references.  
- **Add validation** in setters or use a builder pattern that validates upon construction.  
- **Replace `type` with an enum** (e.g., `PackageType { BOX, ITEM }`).  
- **Add Javadoc** and/or annotations (`@NotNull`, `@Positive`) if using a validation framework.  
- **Consider Lombok** or record types (Java 16+) to reduce boilerplate if the environment supports it.  
- **Unit tests**: Create tests that verify default values and setter behavior, ensuring no accidental changes.  

Overall, `PackageDetails` serves its role as a simple data holder, but it would benefit from minor clean‑ups, documentation, and basic validation to improve robustness.
