# Credentials.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
**Purpose**  
The `Credentials` class models a basic username/password pair that can be reused across the application wherever user authentication data is needed.

**Key components**  
- `userName` – the account identifier.  
- `password` – the secret key.  
- Standard getter/setter pair for each field.  

**Design notes**  
- Declared `abstract` even though it contains no abstract methods.  
- No validation, encryption, or immutability concerns are addressed.  
- No framework‑specific annotations (e.g., JPA, validation) are present, so the class is plain POJO.

## 2. Detailed Description  
The class resides in `com.salesmanager.core.model.system.credentials` and is intended to be a base class for concrete credential types (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens, etc.).  
At runtime:

1. **Instantiation** – Subclasses instantiate `Credentials`, either directly or via dependency injection.  
2. **State mutation** – The `setUserName` and `setPassword` methods allow the values to be changed after construction.  
3. **Access** – Callers retrieve values with `getUserName` and `getPassword`.  

Because the class is abstract, it cannot be instantiated directly. This forces consumers to create a concrete subclass, but the subclass adds no new behavior or constraints. No lifecycle hooks (e.g., `@PostConstruct`) or cleanup logic are present.

**Assumptions / Constraints**  
- The caller is responsible for ensuring password confidentiality.  
- No null checks or validation are performed; passing `null` is allowed.  
- Thread‑safety is not considered – concurrent reads/writes may corrupt state.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Return | Side Effects |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|--------------|
| `getUserName()` | Retrieve the stored user name. | none | `String` | none |
| `setUserName(String userName)` | Assign a new user name. | `String` | `void` | updates internal `userName` field |
| `getPassword()` | Retrieve the stored password. | none | `String` | none |
| `setPassword(String password)` | Assign a new password. | `String` | `void` | updates internal `password` field |

All methods are straightforward getters/setters; there are no utility or helper methods beyond basic field manipulation.

## 4. Dependencies  
- **Standard Java** – only `java.lang.String`.  
- No third‑party libraries or framework annotations are used.  
- The class is platform‑agnostic but relies on Java’s default `Object` behaviour.

## 5. Additional Notes  

### Strengths  
- Minimal, clear, and easy to understand.  
- Provides a common structure that can be extended by more specific credential types.  

### Potential Issues & Edge Cases  
1. **Abstract without contract** – Declaring the class `abstract` gives no functional advantage; it merely forces subclassing. If no subclass is needed, the class should be concrete.  
2. **Plaintext password storage** – The password is stored as a `String` with no encryption, hashing, or secure handling. In production systems, this can expose sensitive data in memory dumps or logs.  
3. **Lack of validation** – `null` or empty strings are accepted, potentially leading to authentication errors downstream.  
4. **Immutability** – Mutable credentials can lead to accidental changes; making the class immutable (final fields, no setters) could improve safety.  
5. **Thread safety** – In multi‑threaded contexts, concurrent modifications could result in race conditions.  
6. **No equals/hashCode** – If credentials need to be compared or stored in collections, overriding `equals()` and `hashCode()` would be necessary.  

### Suggested Enhancements  
- **Make it concrete** unless a specific abstract contract is required.  
- **Add validation** in setters (e.g., non‑null, non‑empty).  
- **Use secure handling**: store passwords as `char[]`, use `PasswordEncoder` (Spring Security) or similar, and clear memory after use.  
- **Immutability**: provide a constructor that sets both fields and remove setters.  
- **Utility methods**: `toString()` that masks the password, `equals()/hashCode()` if needed.  
- **Optional framework integration**: if the application uses JPA/Hibernate, annotate the class for persistence.  
- **Unit tests**: ensure getters/setters behave as expected and that immutability (if added) holds.  

Overall, the class serves as a simple data holder, but it lacks security best‑practice considerations that are crucial for credential handling. Implementing the above enhancements would make the code safer and more robust in a real‑world environment.

```java
package com.salesmanager.core.model.system.credentials;

public abstract class Credentials {
	
	private String userName;
	private String password;
	public String getUserName() {
		return userName;
	}
	public void setUserName(String userName) {
		this.userName = userName;
	}
	public String getPassword() {
		return password;
	}
	public void setPassword(String password) {
		this.password = password;
	}

}
