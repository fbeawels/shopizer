# ShippingType.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
The file defines a **Java `enum`** called `ShippingType` in the package `com.salesmanager.core.model.shipping`.  
It contains two constants, `NATIONAL` and `INTERNATIONAL`, which represent the two supported shipping categories in the Sales Manager domain.

**Key points**

- The enum is minimalistic; it only holds constants and does not provide any behavior or metadata.
- It is placed in the `core.model.shipping` package, suggesting it is part of the domain model rather than a utility or service layer.
- No external libraries or frameworks are referenced – it’s pure Java SE.

---

## 2. Detailed Description  

### Core component
- **`ShippingType` enum** – a type-safe representation of shipping categories.  
  This enum would typically be used wherever the application needs to differentiate between national and international shipping, e.g., in order processing, shipping calculations, or UI dropdowns.

### Interaction
- The enum itself does not interact with other components; it is a value object.  
- In a real project, other domain objects (e.g., `Order`, `Shipment`) would reference it as a field type:  
  ```java
  private ShippingType shippingType;
  ```

### Execution flow
- There is no runtime behavior: the enum is loaded at class initialization time.  
- No cleanup or lifecycle hooks are needed.

### Assumptions & constraints
- **Assumption**: Shipping is a binary choice – only “NATIONAL” or “INTERNATIONAL”.  
- **Constraint**: If the business later needs additional shipping types (e.g., “CARGO”, “EXPRESS”), the enum will need to be extended, potentially requiring migrations of persisted data or configuration changes.

### Architecture & design
- Using an `enum` is appropriate for a closed set of constants and ensures type safety.  
- The design is straightforward and fits a domain‑model approach.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

The enum declares no methods beyond the implicit ones (`values()`, `valueOf()`, `name()`, etc.).  
Since the code snippet is minimal, the “methods” section is effectively empty.  

If additional behavior is required, typical extensions could include:
- `String getCode()` – to expose a short code (e.g., “NAT”, “INT”).
- `boolean isInternational()` – for readability in business logic.
- A static `fromString(String)` – to parse user input safely.

## 4. Dependencies  

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| Java SE (Enum) | Standard | No external libraries are used. |

No platform‑specific or third‑party dependencies.

---

## 5. Additional Notes  

### Documentation
- Adding JavaDoc for the enum and its constants would improve maintainability.  
  ```java
  /**
   * Indicates the shipping category for an order.
   */
  public enum ShippingType { ... }
  ```

### Naming consistency
- `NATIONAL` and `INTERNATIONAL` are clear.  
- If the business later adds more granular types, consider a naming convention that keeps the enum self‑descriptive (e.g., `DOMESTIC`, `INTERNATIONAL`, `CARGO`).

### Extensibility
- Should the system evolve to support multiple shipping methods per order (e.g., “Standard”, “Express”), a dedicated `ShippingMethod` enum might be more appropriate.  
- For more complex metadata (fees, delivery time, carriers), consider using a separate domain class instead of an enum.

### Persistence
- If the enum is stored in a database (e.g., JPA), ensure the mapping strategy is defined (`@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)` is typical).  
- Consider the impact of renaming constants on existing data.

### Edge Cases
- The enum currently assumes only two possible values. Any null handling (e.g., defaulting to `NATIONAL`) must be documented in the consuming code.

### Future Enhancements
1. **Add metadata**: code, description, default shipping cost.  
2. **Validation**: a static factory that throws a clear exception if an invalid value is passed.  
3. **Internationalization**: support localized display names for UI.  
4. **Integration with shipping APIs**: map enum values to external provider codes.

### Quick Suggested Revision

```java
package com.salesmanager.core.model.shipping;

/**
 * Represents the type of shipping for an order.
 */
public enum ShippingType {

    /**
     * Shipping within the same country.
     */
    NATIONAL,

    /**
     * Shipping across international borders.
     */
    INTERNATIONAL;

    // Example of a future extension:
    // public static ShippingType fromCode(String code) { ... }
}
```

This small addition improves readability and sets a foundation for future extensions.
