# PersistableProductReview.java

## Review

## 1. Summary
`PersistableProductReview` is a lightweight Java POJO that represents a product review entity that can be persisted (e.g., to a database or serialized for transmission).  
- **Purpose**: Extends the base `ProductReviewEntity` with an additional `customerId` field that must not be `null`, ensuring that every persisted review can be traced back to a specific customer.  
- **Key Components**:
  - Inheritance from `ProductReviewEntity` (presumably contains common review attributes such as rating, comments, timestamps).
  - Implements `Serializable` to allow instances to be converted into a byte stream (useful for caching, messaging, or storage).
  - Validation annotation `@NotNull` on `customerId` to enforce non‑null constraint during bean validation.
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: Uses JSR‑380 (`javax.validation.constraints.NotNull`), implying the code is intended to run in a Java EE / Jakarta EE or Spring environment where bean validation is available.

## 2. Detailed Description
### Core Components
1. **`PersistableProductReview`** – Subclass of `ProductReviewEntity`.  
2. **`customerId` field** – Stores the identifier of the customer who authored the review.  
3. **Getters/Setters** – Standard JavaBean accessors for `customerId`.

### Interaction & Flow
- **Creation**: When a new review is submitted, an instance of `PersistableProductReview` is created (typically by a controller/service layer).  
- **Validation**: A validator (e.g., Spring’s `@Valid`) checks the `@NotNull` constraint before persistence.  
- **Persistence**: The object is handed to a DAO/Repository that serializes it or maps it to a database row.  
- **Serialization**: Because it implements `Serializable`, the same instance can also be stored in an HTTP session, sent over JMS, or cached.

### Assumptions & Constraints
- The base class `ProductReviewEntity` must be serializable (or at least all its fields are).  
- The environment supports Bean Validation (JSR‑380).  
- `customerId` is the only field needing non‑null enforcement; all other fields rely on constraints defined in `ProductReviewEntity`.

### Design Choices
- **Inheritance**: The decision to extend `ProductReviewEntity` promotes code reuse for shared review attributes.  
- **Serializable**: Explicitly adding `implements Serializable` indicates that the developer expects object transmission beyond a single JVM.  
- **Validation Annotation**: Using `@NotNull` on the field rather than the getter simplifies enforcement and keeps the class pure.

## 3. Functions/Methods
| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Return | Side‑Effects |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|--------------|
| `public Long getCustomerId()` | Retrieve the customer ID associated with the review. | None | `Long` | None |
| `public void setCustomerId(Long customerId)` | Set the customer ID for the review. | `Long customerId` | void | Updates the internal state of the object |

**Notes**:
- No constructors are defined; the default no‑arg constructor is used.
- All logic resides in the base class (`ProductReviewEntity`) and any persistence layer; this class is purely a data holder.

## 4. Dependencies
| Dependency | Type | Usage |
|------------|------|-------|
| `java.io.Serializable` | Standard Java | Enables serialization of the object. |
| `javax.validation.constraints.NotNull` | Third‑party (Bean Validation) | Enforces non‑null constraint at runtime. |
| `com.salesmanager.shop.model.catalog.product.ProductReviewEntity` | Internal | Base class providing core review attributes. |

**Platform assumptions**: The code expects a Java EE or Spring container that supports JSR‑380 bean validation. No specific ORM annotations (e.g., JPA) are present, so mapping is likely handled elsewhere.

---

## 5. Additional Notes
### Strengths
- **Simplicity**: Clear separation of concerns; this class only adds one field.
- **Extensibility**: Future constraints (e.g., `@Min`, `@Max` for rating) can be added easily.
- **Testability**: Plain JavaBean with getters/setters is trivial to unit test.

### Potential Issues / Edge Cases
1. **Missing Validation on Other Fields** – If `ProductReviewEntity` contains mutable fields without validation, invalid data may slip through.  
2. **Serialization Compatibility** – Changing the base class or adding/removing fields without adjusting `serialVersionUID` may lead to `InvalidClassException`.  
3. **Null Customer ID** – While `@NotNull` enforces non‑null at validation time, the field can still be set to `null` programmatically before validation, which may cause silent bugs.  
4. **Immutable Design** – The current mutable design may not be thread‑safe if shared across threads (e.g., in a request scope).  

### Future Enhancements
- **Immutable DTO** – Replace setters with constructor injection or builder pattern for safer handling.  
- **Validation Grouping** – Define custom validation groups for create vs. update scenarios.  
- **JPA/Hibernate Annotations** – If this object is persisted directly, add `@Entity`, `@Table`, and mapping annotations.  
- **DTO Separation** – Keep a separate persistence entity and a DTO for API exposure to avoid leaking internal fields.

Overall, the class is well‑structured for its intended purpose, with clear responsibilities and minimal risk. The review mainly suggests defensive practices and potential architectural refinements for larger systems.

import java.io.Serializable;

import javax.validation.constraints.NotNull;

public class PersistableProductReview extends ProductReviewEntity implements
		Serializable {

	/**
	 * 
	 */
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	@NotNull
	private Long customerId;
	public Long getCustomerId() {
		return customerId;
	}
	public void setCustomerId(Long customerId) {
		this.customerId = customerId;
	}
	


}
