# CountryEntity.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
The file defines a lightweight **`CountryEntity`** domain object that represents a country within the SalesManager shop model.  
- It extends a base `Entity` (presumably providing an ID, timestamps, or common persistence behaviour).  
- The class stores two pieces of state:  
  * `code` – a `String` representing the country code (e.g., “US”, “GB”).  
  * `supported` – a `boolean` flag indicating whether this country is currently supported by the system.  
- Standard getter/setter methods expose these properties.

**Key points**  
- No persistence annotations are present; the entity is likely mapped through XML or a framework‑specific convention.  
- The class is `Serializable` via the inherited `Entity` interface (serialVersionUID is declared).  
- The design follows a plain‑old‑Java‑object (POJO) pattern, making it easy to serialize, map to JSON, or use in JPA/Hibernate when annotations are added.

## 2. Detailed Description  
### Core Components  
| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `CountryEntity` | Represents a country, holding its code and support status. |
| `Entity` (superclass) | Provides common entity properties (ID, created/updated timestamps, etc.). |

### Execution Flow  
- **Construction**: Instantiated by the persistence framework or manually.  
- **Runtime**: Properties are set via setters or through constructor injection.  
- **Persistence**: When persisted, the superclass likely handles ID generation and lifecycle events.  
- **Serialization**: `serialVersionUID` ensures stable deserialization across versions.  

### Assumptions & Constraints  
- The base `Entity` is serializable and provides an ID field; this file trusts that behaviour.  
- No validation is performed on `code` – any string is accepted.  
- The `supported` flag is a simple boolean; no enum or state machine is used.

### Architecture & Design Choices  
- **Simplicity**: The class is intentionally minimal to keep the domain model lightweight.  
- **Extensibility**: By extending `Entity`, new common fields can be added centrally.  
- **No business logic**: The class is a pure data container, following the DTO pattern.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Side‑Effects |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
| `getCode()` | Retrieve the country code. | None | `String` code | None |
| `setCode(String code)` | Set the country code. | `String code` | None | Updates internal field |
| `isSupported()` | Check if the country is supported. | None | `boolean` | None |
| `setSupported(boolean supported)` | Mark the country as supported/unsupported. | `boolean supported` | None | Updates internal field |

### Reusable / Utility Methods  
The class contains no reusable utilities; it is purely a data holder.

## 4. Dependencies  
| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `com.salesmanager.shop.model.entity.Entity` | Internal | Provides base entity fields and serializable behaviour. |
| `java.io.Serializable` | Standard | Inherited via `Entity`; ensures serializable capability. |

No third‑party libraries, frameworks, or platform‑specific dependencies are referenced directly in this file.

## 5. Additional Notes  

### Edge Cases / Potential Issues  
1. **Null `code`** – No validation allows `code` to be `null`, which could lead to `NullPointerException` when the code is used as a key.  
2. **Immutability** – The entity is mutable; unintended changes may occur if references are shared across threads.  
3. **Missing `equals()/hashCode()`** – Without these overrides, collection lookups or caching based on `CountryEntity` instances may behave incorrectly.  
4. **Missing `toString()`** – Debug output will use the default `Object.toString()`, which is not helpful.

### Recommendations for Enhancement  
| Area | Suggested Improvement |
|------|-----------------------|
| **Validation** | Add a `@NotNull`/`@Pattern` annotation or a constructor that checks `code` against ISO‑3166. |
| **Immutability** | Provide an immutable builder or make fields `final` after construction if possible. |
| **Utility Methods** | Override `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` based on `code`. |
| **Persistence Mapping** | If using JPA/Hibernate, annotate the class with `@Entity` and map fields with `@Column`. |
| **Documentation** | Add Javadoc comments explaining the semantics of `supported` and typical use cases. |
| **Unit Tests** | Write simple tests to verify getters/setters, immutability, and serialization. |

Overall, the class is clean and straightforward. The primary focus for future work would be to enforce data integrity, improve traceability (via `toString`), and align with the persistence framework in use.

```java
package com.salesmanager.shop.model.references;

import com.salesmanager.shop.model.entity.Entity;

public class CountryEntity extends Entity {

	/**
	 * 
	 */
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	
	private String code;
	private boolean supported;

	public String getCode() {
		return code;
	}

	public void setCode(String code) {
		this.code = code;
	}

	public boolean isSupported() {
		return supported;
	}

	public void setSupported(boolean supported) {
		this.supported = supported;
	}
