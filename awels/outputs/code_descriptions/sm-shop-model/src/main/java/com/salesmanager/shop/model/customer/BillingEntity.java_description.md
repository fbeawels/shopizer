# BillingEntity.java

## Review

## 1. Summary

**Purpose & Functionality**  
`BillingEntity` is a simple Java bean that represents a customer’s billing information in the `com.salesmanager.shop.model.customer` package.  It extends `Address`, thereby inheriting all the address‑related fields and behaviours (street, city, zip, etc.).  The class augments the address with three additional pieces of data that are specific to billing:

1. **email** – the customer’s contact email used for invoices and notifications.  
2. **countryName** – human‑readable name of the country.  
3. **provinceName** – human‑readable name of the province/state.

**Key Components**  
- `BillingEntity` extends `Address`.  
- Serializable (via `serialVersionUID`).  
- Standard JavaBeans getters/setters for the three new properties.

**Design Patterns / Libraries**  
- No explicit design patterns are employed.  
- Relies on Java’s standard `Serializable` interface and standard bean conventions.  
- The class is part of a larger domain model for a shopping/CRM application (`com.salesmanager.shop`).

## 2. Detailed Description

### Core Components & Interaction
1. **Inheritance** – By extending `Address`, `BillingEntity` automatically gains all fields/methods defined in `Address`.  This is a straightforward “is‑a” relationship: a billing entity *is* an address with extra metadata.
2. **Serialization** – Declares a `serialVersionUID`, implying that instances of this class may be serialized/deserialized (e.g., for HTTP session replication, caching, or messaging).
3. **Properties** – Three new string properties (`email`, `countryName`, `provinceName`) are declared, each with public getter/setter pairs.

### Execution Flow
- **Construction** – The class inherits constructors from `Address`.  Because no explicit constructor is defined, the default no‑arg constructor is provided by the compiler.  
- **Runtime** – Typical usage will involve:
  - Instantiating the object (`new BillingEntity()`).
  - Populating address fields (via inherited setters).
  - Setting the three additional properties via their setters.
  - Passing the object to business logic, persistence layer, or a view layer.

### Assumptions & Constraints
- **Nullability** – All fields are plain `String`.  No explicit validation or annotations (`@NotNull`, `@Email`, etc.) are present, so callers must handle null/empty values themselves.
- **Locale** – `countryName` and `provinceName` are human‑readable, but no locale handling is built‑in.  If multi‑language support is required, additional logic elsewhere is needed.
- **Address Hierarchy** – The code assumes that `Address` is serializable and contains all required address information (street, city, postal code, country code, etc.).  The `BillingEntity` does not override any of these behaviours.

### Architecture & Design Choices
- **Simple Value Object** – The class is deliberately lightweight, adhering to the JavaBeans convention for easy integration with frameworks like Spring, JPA, or Jackson.  
- **No Validation** – Validation logic is omitted, keeping the domain object POJO‑like and delegating concerns to service or controller layers.  
- **Extensibility** – Adding more billing‑specific fields would simply involve adding more properties with getters/setters, following the same pattern.

## 3. Functions/Methods

| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Returns | Side Effects |
|--------|---------|------------|---------|--------------|
| `public String getCountryName()` | Retrieve the human‑readable country name. | None | `String` | None |
| `public void setCountryName(String countryName)` | Set the human‑readable country name. | `String countryName` | `void` | Updates internal state |
| `public String getProvinceName()` | Retrieve the human‑readable province/state name. | None | `String` | None |
| `public void setProvinceName(String provinceName)` | Set the human‑readable province/state name. | `String provinceName` | `void` | Updates internal state |
| `public String getEmail()` | Retrieve the customer’s billing email. | None | `String` | None |
| `public void setEmail(String email)` | Set the customer’s billing email. | `String email` | `void` | Updates internal state |

All getters simply return the current field value; all setters mutate the object state without performing any validation or transformation.

## 4. Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `com.salesmanager.shop.model.customer.address.Address` | Internal | Provides address fields; must implement `Serializable` for compatibility. |
| `java.io.Serializable` | Standard | Enables Java serialization. |
| No external third‑party libraries or frameworks are directly referenced in this class. |

## 5. Additional Notes

### Strengths
- **Simplicity** – The class is minimalistic and easy to understand.  
- **Reusability** – Extending `Address` promotes code reuse across billing and shipping contexts.  
- **Framework Friendly** – Conforms to JavaBean conventions, making it trivially usable with Spring, JPA, Jackson, etc.

### Weaknesses / Edge Cases
- **No Validation** – The class trusts callers to provide valid data.  If invalid data (e.g., malformed email, null country names) is injected, downstream layers may fail silently.  
- **No `toString`, `equals`, `hashCode`** – The class inherits these from `Object`; custom implementations might be needed for logging, caching, or collections.  
- **Locale & Internationalization** – `countryName`/`provinceName` are language‑specific strings.  If the application supports multiple locales, additional locale handling is required.  
- **Null Handling** – Getters may return `null`; callers must guard against `NullPointerException`.  

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Add Validation Annotations**  
   - `@Email`, `@NotBlank`, `@Size` (Hibernate Validator) for `email`.  
   - Custom annotations for `countryName` and `provinceName` to ensure they correspond to known values.  

2. **Override `equals` & `hashCode`**  
   - Base equality on a combination of address fields plus `email` to support use in collections or as map keys.  

3. **Add `toString`**  
   - Provide a human‑readable representation for debugging.  

4. **Builder Pattern**  
   - Facilitate immutable construction or a fluent API for creating instances, especially if future fields are added.  

5. **Internationalization Support**  
   - Store country and province codes (ISO) rather than names, and resolve the display names via a locale‑aware service.  

6. **Immutability**  
   - If thread‑safety or functional style is desired, convert the class to an immutable value object.  

7. **JPA Mapping (if persistence is needed)**  
   - Annotate with `@Entity`, `@Table`, and map fields to columns, ensuring that `Address` is also persistable.  

8. **Serialization Strategy**  
   - Consider using JSON serialization (Jackson) with annotations if the object is exposed over REST APIs.

Overall, the class fulfills its basic role as a data holder but would benefit from lightweight validation and richer utility methods to make it more robust in a production environment.

import com.salesmanager.shop.model.customer.address.Address;

public class BillingEntity extends Address {

	/**
	 * 
	 */
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	
	private String email;

	private String countryName;

	private String provinceName;

	public String getCountryName() {
		return countryName;
	}

	public void setCountryName(String countryName) {
		this.countryName = countryName;
	}

	public String getProvinceName() {
		return provinceName;
	}

	public void setProvinceName(String provinceName) {
		this.provinceName = provinceName;
	}

	public String getEmail() {
		return email;
	}

	public void setEmail(String email) {
