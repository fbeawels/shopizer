# SizeReferences.java

## Review

## 1. Summary
- **Purpose**: The `SizeReferences` class is a plain Java object (POJO) used to encapsulate two collections of reference data for a product size catalogue: `WeightUnit` objects and `MeasureUnit` objects.  
- **Key Components**:  
  - `weights`: a `List` of `WeightUnit` instances.  
  - `measures`: a `List` of `MeasureUnit` instances.  
- **Design Pattern**: Follows the *JavaBean* pattern with private fields and public getters/setters.  
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: None explicitly imported; relies on Java SE (`java.util.List`). It is likely used in a larger e‑commerce framework (e.g., Spring MVC, JPA) where these lists are populated from a database or external service.

## 2. Detailed Description
### Core Structure
```java
public class SizeReferences {
    private List<WeightUnit> weights;
    private List<MeasureUnit> measures;
    // getters / setters
}
```
- The class holds two collections that represent reference data for product sizing:  
  - **Weight units** (e.g., kilograms, pounds).  
  - **Measure units** (e.g., inches, centimeters).  
- Each list is a simple `java.util.List`, meaning the order of units is preserved but no guarantee of uniqueness.

### Execution Flow
1. **Instantiation**: A caller creates an instance of `SizeReferences`.  
2. **Population**: The caller (or a service layer) populates the lists via the setters.  
3. **Usage**: The populated object is passed around—commonly to a controller or a view layer—to render reference options or to validate size data.  
4. **Cleanup**: No special cleanup is required; the object relies on Java’s garbage collector.

### Assumptions & Constraints
- **Nullability**: The class does not enforce non‑null lists. A caller could leave `weights` or `measures` as `null`, leading to `NullPointerException` if the caller iterates without checking.  
- **Mutability**: The exposed getters return the actual list instance, so external code can modify the contents.  
- **Thread Safety**: No synchronization; intended for single‑threaded or request‑scoped usage.

## 3. Functions/Methods
| Method | Description | Parameters | Returns | Side‑Effects |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------|--------------|
| `getWeights()` | Returns the list of `WeightUnit` objects. | None | `List<WeightUnit>` | None |
| `setWeights(List<WeightUnit> weights)` | Assigns the provided list to the internal `weights` field. | `List<WeightUnit> weights` | None | Updates internal state |
| `getMeasures()` | Returns the list of `MeasureUnit` objects. | None | `List<MeasureUnit>` | None |
| `setMeasures(List<MeasureUnit> measures)` | Assigns the provided list to the internal `measures` field. | `List<MeasureUnit> measures` | None | Updates internal state |

**Reusable/Utility Methods**: None beyond standard getters/setters.

## 4. Dependencies
| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `java.util.List` | Standard Java SE | Requires `java.util` package. |
| `com.salesmanager.shop.model.references.WeightUnit` | Project-specific | Must exist elsewhere in the project. |
| `com.salesmanager.shop.model.references.MeasureUnit` | Project-specific | Must exist elsewhere in the project. |

No external third‑party libraries or platform‑specific APIs are referenced.

## 5. Additional Notes
### Edge Cases & Potential Issues
- **Null Lists**: If a caller never sets one of the lists, `getWeights()` or `getMeasures()` will return `null`. Subsequent code that iterates over these lists should perform a null‑check to avoid `NullPointerException`.  
- **Immutability**: Exposing the internal list allows unintended modifications. Consider returning an unmodifiable view (`Collections.unmodifiableList`) or making defensive copies.  
- **Equality / Hashing**: The class does not override `equals`, `hashCode`, or `toString`. If instances are used in collections or logging, providing these methods would improve traceability.  
- **Serialization**: If the object needs to be serialized (e.g., to JSON for a REST API), ensure that `WeightUnit` and `MeasureUnit` are serializable (Jackson annotations, etc.).  

### Possible Enhancements
1. **Constructor Injection**: Add a constructor that accepts both lists, reducing the risk of nulls.  
2. **Builder Pattern**: For more flexible construction, especially if the number of reference types grows.  
3. **Validation**: Validate that the lists contain non‑null elements and optionally enforce uniqueness.  
4. **Documentation**: Javadoc comments for the class and each method would aid maintainability.  
5. **Unit Tests**: Simple tests to confirm that setters/getters work and that null handling behaves as expected.  

Overall, the class serves its purpose as a data holder in the application’s domain model. The main improvement areas involve defensive programming (null checks, immutability) and enhanced documentation to aid future developers.

public class SizeReferences {
	
	private List<WeightUnit> weights;
	private List<MeasureUnit> measures;
	public List<WeightUnit> getWeights() {
		return weights;
	}
	public void setWeights(List<WeightUnit> weights) {
		this.weights = weights;
	}
	public List<MeasureUnit> getMeasures() {
		return measures;
	}
	public void setMeasures(List<MeasureUnit> measures) {
		this.measures = measures;
	}
