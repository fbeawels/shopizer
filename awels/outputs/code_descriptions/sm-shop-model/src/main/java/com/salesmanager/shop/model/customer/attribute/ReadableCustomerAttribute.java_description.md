# ReadableCustomerAttribute.java

## Review

## 1. Summary
`ReadableCustomerAttribute` is a lightweight DTO (Data Transfer Object) that extends the domain entity `CustomerAttributeEntity`.  
It adds two read‑only reference fields:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `customerOption` | `ReadableCustomerOption` | Holds the option (e.g., “Color”) associated with the attribute. |
| `customerOptionValue` | `ReadableCustomerOptionValue` | Holds the chosen value for the option (e.g., “Red”). |

This class is designed for use in the web or REST layer where a fully‑populated entity is not needed; only the readable (i.e., view‑friendly) option/value pairs are exposed.

The class follows a very simple POJO pattern – no frameworks or annotations are required.

---

## 2. Detailed Description
### Core components
- **Inheritance** – `ReadableCustomerAttribute` inherits all fields and behaviour from `CustomerAttributeEntity`.  
  This suggests that the entity already contains identifiers, timestamps, and possibly a reference to the customer.
- **Additional fields** – Two `Readable*` objects are added to expose the option and its value in a form that is easy to serialize to JSON or present in a UI.

### Flow of execution
1. **Construction** – The default (no‑arg) constructor from `CustomerAttributeEntity` is used.  
   No custom logic is executed in `ReadableCustomerAttribute`.
2. **Population** – A service layer or mapper populates the object:
   ```java
   ReadableCustomerAttribute attr = new ReadableCustomerAttribute();
   attr.setCustomerOption(option);
   attr.setCustomerOptionValue(value);
   ```
3. **Usage** – The DTO is returned from a controller or service to the client (JSON/XML).  
   The two `Readable*` objects are likely serializable and contain only the fields required by the view.

### Assumptions & constraints
- The base entity must have a `serialVersionUID` matching the class version; the subclass declares its own `serialVersionUID = 1L`, which is fine but may lead to versioning confusion if the base class changes.
- No validation or immutability; the class is mutable, which is typical for DTOs but can introduce side effects if shared across threads.

### Architecture & design choices
- **DTO Pattern** – A separate class is used to decouple the persistence entity from what is exposed externally.
- **Extensibility** – By extending `CustomerAttributeEntity`, any changes in the base entity automatically propagate, but it also couples the DTO tightly to the entity hierarchy. A composition‑over‑inheritance approach might provide more flexibility.

## 3. Functions/Methods
| Method | Signature | Purpose | Notes |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------|
| `setCustomerOption(ReadableCustomerOption)` | `void` | Assigns the option reference. | Straightforward setter; no validation. |
| `getCustomerOption()` | `ReadableCustomerOption` | Retrieves the option. | Returns null if not set. |
| `setCustomerOptionValue(ReadableCustomerOptionValue)` | `void` | Assigns the option value reference. | Straightforward setter; no validation. |
| `getCustomerOptionValue()` | `ReadableCustomerOptionValue` | Retrieves the option value. | Returns null if not set. |

There are no constructors, overloaded methods, or helper utilities. The class is intentionally minimal.

---

## 4. Dependencies
| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `com.salesmanager.shop.model.customer.attribute.CustomerAttributeEntity` | Parent class | Presumably part of the same project; no external library. |
| `ReadableCustomerOption` | DTO | Must be available in the same package or imported. |
| `ReadableCustomerOptionValue` | DTO | Same as above. |

No external frameworks (Spring, Jackson, etc.) are referenced directly. The class relies on Java serialization (`serialVersionUID`) but does not use `Serializable` explicitly; it inherits from the parent which likely implements it.

---

## 5. Additional Notes
### Edge cases
- **Null handling** – The getters may return `null`; callers must be prepared to handle missing option/value pairs.  
- **Thread safety** – As a mutable object, concurrent writes could corrupt state if shared across threads.  
- **Serialization** – The `serialVersionUID` of 1L may not match the parent’s UID; if the parent changes, deserialization could fail. Consider aligning UIDs or avoiding inheritance for DTOs.

### Potential improvements
1. **Immutable DTO** – Create an immutable constructor that requires all fields, improving thread safety and reducing accidental modification.
2. **Validation** – Add simple null checks or builder patterns to enforce that an attribute always has an option/value when constructed.
3. **Separate from entity** – Use composition rather than inheritance; keep `ReadableCustomerAttribute` independent of `CustomerAttributeEntity` to avoid accidental coupling.
4. **Add `toString()`, `equals()`, `hashCode()`** – Helpful for logging and unit tests.

Overall, the class serves its purpose as a lightweight data holder, but it could benefit from a few defensive programming practices to make it more robust in larger, multi‑threaded or API‑driven environments.

```java
package com.salesmanager.shop.model.customer.attribute;

public class ReadableCustomerAttribute extends CustomerAttributeEntity {

	/**
	 * 
	 */
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	private ReadableCustomerOption customerOption;
	private ReadableCustomerOptionValue customerOptionValue;
	public void setCustomerOption(ReadableCustomerOption customerOption) {
		this.customerOption = customerOption;
	}
	public ReadableCustomerOption getCustomerOption() {
		return customerOption;
	}
	public void setCustomerOptionValue(ReadableCustomerOptionValue customerOptionValue) {
		this.customerOptionValue = customerOptionValue;
	}
	public ReadableCustomerOptionValue getCustomerOptionValue() {
		return customerOptionValue;
	}



}
