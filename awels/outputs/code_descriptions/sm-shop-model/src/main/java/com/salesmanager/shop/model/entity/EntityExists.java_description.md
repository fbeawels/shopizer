# EntityExists.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
The file defines a very small Plain Old Java Object (POJO) named **`EntityExists`** that simply wraps a boolean flag indicating whether a particular entity is present. It implements `Serializable` and provides a default constructor, a parameterised constructor, and standard getter/setter methods.

**Key points**

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `exists` field | Stores the boolean state |
| `isExists()` / `setExists(boolean)` | Accessor/mutator |
| `serialVersionUID` | Version control for Java serialization |

There are no frameworks or libraries involved – the class is entirely self‑contained.

---

## 2. Detailed Description  
The class lives in `com.salesmanager.shop.model.entity`. It is meant to be a lightweight flag holder, likely used in service layers or DAO responses to indicate the presence or absence of a record without carrying the full entity.

**Execution flow**

1. **Instantiation**  
   - `new EntityExists()` creates an instance with `exists = false`.  
   - `new EntityExists(true)` creates an instance with `exists = true`.

2. **Runtime usage**  
   - Call `isExists()` to read the state.  
   - Call `setExists(false/true)` to change it.

3. **Serialization**  
   - Because it implements `Serializable`, the class can be sent over the wire or persisted. The `serialVersionUID` of `1L` guarantees compatibility across versions unless the class definition changes in a breaking way.

There is no cleanup logic; the class is essentially a data container.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Signature | Purpose | Parameters | Returns | Side‑effects |
|--------|-----------|---------|------------|---------|--------------|
| **Constructor** | `EntityExists()` | Creates an instance with `exists = false`. | – | – | – |
| **Constructor** | `EntityExists(boolean exists)` | Creates an instance with the supplied flag. | `exists` | – | – |
| `isExists()` | `public boolean isExists()` | Getter for the flag. | – | `boolean` | – |
| `setExists(boolean)` | `public void setExists(boolean exists)` | Setter for the flag. | `exists` | – | Mutates the field |

No other methods are present. All operations are O(1) and thread‑safe by virtue of the primitive type (though the object itself is mutable).

---

## 4. Dependencies  

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `java.io.Serializable` | Standard Java | Allows instances to be serialized. |
| `java.lang.*` | Standard Java | Used implicitly. |

There are **no third‑party libraries** or external APIs. The code is platform‑agnostic.

## 5. Additional Notes  

### Strengths  
* **Simplicity** – minimal code, clear intent.  
* **Serialisable** – useful for DTOs in distributed systems.  
* **No external dependencies** – easy to drop into any project.

### Areas for Improvement  

1. **Naming**  
   * `EntityExists` can be confusing – it sounds like a method name. A name such as `EntityExistence` or `EntityPresence` would be more descriptive.

2. **Immutability**  
   * The class is mutable. If the flag should never change after construction, make the field `final`, remove the setter, and provide only a constructor.

3. **Standard method overrides**  
   * Implement `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` for better debugging and collection behaviour.

4. **Documentation**  
   * Add Javadoc to the class and its methods explaining when this DTO is expected to be used.

5. **Alternative Patterns**  
   * If the flag is the only data, consider using a single `boolean` in the surrounding context or a `Boolean` return type.  
   * Or use an `enum` with two constants `YES`/`NO` if you want a type‑safe approach.

6. **Thread‑safety**  
   * If instances are shared across threads, synchronisation or immutability would be required.  

### Edge Cases  

* The class does not prevent `null` being passed to the constructor (though the argument is primitive, so it cannot be null).  
* No validation or business logic – this is fine given its purpose.

### Future Enhancements  

* Add a static factory method `public static EntityExists of(boolean exists)` for a more fluent API.  
* If the project uses Lombok, replace the boilerplate with `@Data` or `@Value`.  
* Consider persisting the flag as part of a larger DTO rather than a standalone object.

Overall, the code fulfills its minimal purpose, but a few naming and design tweaks would increase clarity and robustness.

```java
package com.salesmanager.shop.model.entity;

import java.io.Serializable;

public class EntityExists implements Serializable {
	
	/**
	 * 
	 */
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	private boolean exists = false;
	
	public EntityExists() {
		
	}

	public EntityExists(boolean exists) {
		this.exists = exists;
	}

	public boolean isExists() {
		return exists;
	}

	public void setExists(boolean exists) {
		this.exists = exists;
	}

}
