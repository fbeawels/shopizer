## Review

## 1. Summary

`ReadableCustomerReview` is a simple Java POJO that represents a customer review enriched with the *readable* (DTO‑style) customer that the review is directed to.  
- **Inheritance** – it extends `CustomerReviewEntity`, inheriting whatever fields (`id`, `rating`, `comment`, etc.) that base entity contains.  
- **Additional field** – `ReadableCustomer reviewedCustomer` is added, together with the usual getter and setter.  
- **Serialization** – `serialVersionUID` is defined, implying the class is intended to be serialised (e.g. sent over the wire or persisted in a session).  
- **Design pattern** – This is a typical *DTO* (Data Transfer Object) used to carry data from service layers to presentation layers.  
- **Frameworks / libraries** – No explicit framework annotations are present, so it is framework‑agnostic at the moment.

## 2. Detailed Description

### Core Components & Interaction
| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `CustomerReviewEntity` | Base entity that holds core review information. |
| `ReadableCustomerReview` | Adds a readable representation of the reviewed customer. |
| `ReadableCustomer` | Likely another DTO that contains human‑friendly customer details (name, avatar, etc.). |

During normal execution:
1. **Construction** – The application (e.g., a service layer) creates an instance of `ReadableCustomerReview`, copies data from a persistence entity or external API, and sets `reviewedCustomer`.  
2. **Transport / Serialization** – Because the class implements `Serializable`, it can be written to a session or transmitted via RMI, JMS, etc.  
3. **Consumption** – A UI layer or REST endpoint may use the object directly, or it may be mapped to a JSON/XML representation.

There is no explicit cleanup logic; the class is purely a data holder.

### Assumptions & Constraints
- The base class `CustomerReviewEntity` must itself be `Serializable`.  
- No validation is performed on `reviewedCustomer`; callers are responsible for ensuring a non‑null or properly initialised instance.  
- The design assumes that extending the base entity is semantically correct (i.e., a `ReadableCustomerReview` can be treated as a `CustomerReviewEntity`).  
- The presence of `serialVersionUID` suggests a requirement for version‑controlled serialization; any changes to the field structure would need a new UID.

### Architecture & Design Choices
- **Inheritance vs. Composition** – Extending the entity keeps the DTO “close” to the database model but can violate the *Liskov Substitution Principle* if the subclass introduces constraints that the base class does not.  
- **Explicit Getters/Setters** – This manual approach is clear but verbose; modern projects often use Lombok or record types to reduce boilerplate.  
- **No Annotations** – The class is framework‑agnostic, but lacks Jackson (`@JsonProperty`), JPA (`@Entity`), or validation (`@NotNull`) annotations that might be needed in a Spring or JPA context.

## 3. Functions/Methods

| Method | Signature | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Side Effects |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
| `getReviewedCustomer()` | `public ReadableCustomer getReviewedCustomer()` | Retrieve the customer that is being reviewed. | None | `ReadableCustomer` instance or `null` | None |
| `setReviewedCustomer(ReadableCustomer reviewedCustomer)` | `public void setReviewedCustomer(ReadableCustomer reviewedCustomer)` | Assign the reviewed customer. | `ReadableCustomer` instance | None | Updates the internal field |

**Notes:**
- No other methods are defined; inheritance brings along any methods from `CustomerReviewEntity`.  
- The class could benefit from an overridden `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()` for debugging and collection handling.

## 4. Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `CustomerReviewEntity` | Internal | Must be part of the same codebase (`com.salesmanager.shop.model.customer`). |
| `ReadableCustomer` | Internal | Another DTO; likely holds user details. |
| Java SE `Serializable` | Standard | Enables serialization. |
| No external libraries | — | The snippet itself does not reference any third‑party frameworks. |

If the project uses Spring, Jackson, or JPA, those frameworks would interact with this DTO at runtime, but no explicit annotations are present.

## 5. Additional Notes

### Edge Cases & Potential Issues
- **Null Handling** – The getter may return `null`; consumers must guard against `NullPointerException`.  
- **Serialization Mismatch** – If the base entity changes (adds or removes fields), the `serialVersionUID` may need updating; otherwise, deserialization will fail.  
- **Inheritance Pitfall** – Should the base entity be modified to add constraints or behavior, the subclass must be reviewed for compatibility.

### Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Add Javadoc** for the class and its methods to clarify intent (e.g., “DTO representing a review together with the human‑readable customer data”).  
2. **Provide a No‑Arg Constructor** (explicitly or via Lombok) for frameworks that require it (e.g., Jackson, JPA).  
3. **Override `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()`** – useful for logging and collections.  
4. **Consider Composition over Inheritance** – instead of extending `CustomerReviewEntity`, contain it:
   ```java
   public class ReadableCustomerReview {
       private final CustomerReviewEntity review;
       private ReadableCustomer reviewedCustomer;
   }
   ```
   This keeps the DTO free of persistence concerns and adheres to the *Single Responsibility Principle*.  
5. **Validation Annotations** – If the class is used in a Spring MVC controller, add `@NotNull` or custom validators to ensure `reviewedCustomer` is provided.  
6. **Jackson Annotations** – Add `@JsonProperty` or `@JsonInclude` if you need precise control over JSON serialization.  
7. **Lombok** – If the project permits, use `@Data`, `@NoArgsConstructor`, and `@AllArgsConstructor` to reduce boilerplate.

### Future Enhancements
- **Immutable DTO** – Make the class immutable (final fields, no setters) for safer concurrency.  
- **DTO Mapping** – Introduce a mapper (e.g., MapStruct) to convert between entity and DTO layers cleanly.  
- **Versioned API** – If this DTO is exposed via a REST API, consider adding a version field or using separate DTOs per API version.

---

**Conclusion:**  
The `ReadableCustomerReview` class is a minimal, well‑intentioned DTO that extends a base review entity to include readable customer data. While functional, it would benefit from added documentation, safer construction patterns, and a review of the inheritance strategy to ensure long‑term maintainability.

```java
package com.salesmanager.shop.model.customer;

public class ReadableCustomerReview extends CustomerReviewEntity {
	
	/**
	 * 
	 */
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	private ReadableCustomer reviewedCustomer;
	public ReadableCustomer getReviewedCustomer() {
		return reviewedCustomer;
	}
	public void setReviewedCustomer(ReadableCustomer reviewedCustomer) {
		this.reviewedCustomer = reviewedCustomer;
	}


}
