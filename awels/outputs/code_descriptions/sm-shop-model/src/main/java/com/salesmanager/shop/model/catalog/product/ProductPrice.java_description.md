# ProductPrice.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  

The file defines a very small POJO – `ProductPrice` – that extends an `Entity` base class.  
Its only contents are:

* a `serialVersionUID` for Java serialization,  
* a public static final `DEFAULT_PRICE_CODE` constant.

The class appears to be a *stub* or placeholder, likely intended to represent pricing information for a product in the **SalesManager** shop domain model. No fields, constructors, or behavior are provided, so the current implementation cannot store or manipulate price data.

### Key Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `Entity` superclass | Provides common entity behavior (id, timestamps, etc.). |
| `serialVersionUID` | Ensures serialization compatibility. |
| `DEFAULT_PRICE_CODE` | Constant used as a default key for a price type. |

No design patterns, frameworks, or libraries are explicitly referenced beyond the inheritance from `Entity`.

## 2. Detailed Description  

### Core Structure

```java
public class ProductPrice extends Entity {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    public final static String DEFAULT_PRICE_CODE = "base";
}
```

The class is a **data holder** that currently contains no state of its own. It relies entirely on whatever is defined in `Entity`. Because there are no instance fields, the class cannot encapsulate a price value, currency, or any other relevant data.  

### Execution Flow

1. **Compilation** – The compiler will treat `ProductPrice` as a subclass of `Entity`.  
2. **Runtime** – Instances can be created (e.g., `new ProductPrice()`). However, since there is no constructor or state, the object will only carry whatever behaviour `Entity` provides.  
3. **Serialization** – The `serialVersionUID` allows the class to participate in Java’s built‑in serialization mechanism.

### Assumptions & Dependencies

| Assumption | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| `Entity` contains necessary persistence fields (e.g., id, version). | Without custom fields, `ProductPrice` is effectively an empty entity. |
| The system uses the constant `DEFAULT_PRICE_CODE` to look up a base price in a map or database. | The constant itself is fine, but its use is not shown in this snippet. |

### Architecture & Design Choices

* **Inheritance** – The decision to extend `Entity` is appropriate if the project uses a base entity for all domain objects.  
* **Immutability** – The constant is immutable; however, the class offers no immutability guarantees for future fields.  
* **Serialization** – Declaring `serialVersionUID` suggests the entity will be persisted or transferred, which aligns with typical JPA or Hibernate usage.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Description | Inputs | Outputs | Side‑Effects |
|--------|-------------|--------|---------|--------------|
| **None** | The class contains no explicit methods. | – | – | – |

> **Note:** Because the class has no fields or methods, it currently provides no functionality beyond the inherited behavior from `Entity`.

## 4. Dependencies  

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `com.salesmanager.shop.model.entity.Entity` | Project‑specific | Provides common entity behavior (id, timestamps). |
| `java.io.Serializable` | Standard | Implied by `Entity` if it implements `Serializable`. |

No third‑party libraries or frameworks are referenced directly in this file.

## 5. Additional Notes  

### Missing Functionality

* **Price Representation** – A real `ProductPrice` should expose fields such as:
  * `BigDecimal amount`  
  * `String currencyCode`  
  * `String priceCode` (defaulted to `DEFAULT_PRICE_CODE`)  
* **Constructors** – Parameterless and parameterized constructors for easy instantiation.  
* **Getters/Setters** – To access and mutate price data (or, if immutable, only getters).  
* **Business Methods** – e.g., `applyTax(BigDecimal taxRate)`, `convertCurrency(String targetCurrency, BigDecimal rate)`.

### Serialization

The explicit `serialVersionUID` is good practice, but if additional fields are added, ensure that the value is updated appropriately or consider using `@Serial` annotation (Java 17+) to document the serialization contract.

### Design Patterns

If the application already uses a **DTO** or **Domain Model** separation, consider whether `ProductPrice` should be a **Value Object** (immutable) or an **Entity** (managed by persistence). A Value Object would not need an `id` and could use `equals()`/`hashCode()` based on its fields.

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Add JPA/Hibernate Annotations** – e.g., `@Entity`, `@Table(name = "product_price")`, `@Column` mappings for each field.  
2. **Validation** – Use Bean Validation (`@NotNull`, `@DecimalMin`) to enforce business rules.  
3. **Utility Methods** – e.g., `public static ProductPrice basePrice(BigDecimal amount)` for convenience.  
4. **JSON Serialization** – Add Jackson annotations if the object is exposed via REST.  

### Edge Cases & Error Handling

* **Null Values** – Without setters or constructors, null handling is trivial, but future methods should guard against `null` amounts or currency codes.  
* **Currency Conversion** – If the class supports conversions, it should handle missing exchange rates gracefully.

---

### Bottom Line

The current `ProductPrice` class is essentially a scaffold awaiting real implementation. To be useful, it needs:

1. **Concrete state** (price amount, currency, etc.).  
2. **Accessors and mutators** (or an immutable design).  
3. **Persistence or serialization hooks** if it’s meant to be stored in a database or transmitted over the wire.

Adding these elements will turn the stub into a functional component of the catalog product model.

package com.salesmanager.shop.model.catalog.product;

import com.salesmanager.shop.model.entity.Entity;

public class ProductPrice extends Entity {

	/**
	 * 
	 */
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	
	public final static String DEFAULT_PRICE_CODE="base";

}
