## Review

## 1. Summary

**Purpose & Functionality**  
`ReadableProductReview` is a Data Transfer Object (DTO) that represents a product review in a readable form for the shop layer. It extends the base entity `ProductReviewEntity` (which presumably contains the core review data such as rating, comment, timestamps, etc.) and adds a reference to the customer who authored the review.  

**Key Components**  
- **Inheritance** – Inherits fields/methods from `ProductReviewEntity`.  
- **Serializable** – Implements `Serializable` to allow the DTO to be transmitted or cached.  
- **Customer Association** – Holds a `ReadableCustomer` instance, exposing it through standard getter/setter.  

**Design Patterns / Frameworks**  
- *DTO (Data Transfer Object)* – The class is used to transfer review data between layers (e.g., from the persistence layer to the API).  
- *Serializable marker interface* – Standard Java pattern for enabling object serialization. No other framework annotations (e.g., JPA, Jackson) are present.

## 2. Detailed Description

### Core Structure
```java
public class ReadableProductReview extends ProductReviewEntity implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    private ReadableCustomer customer;
    // getter / setter
}
```
- **`ProductReviewEntity`** – Provides base fields (id, rating, comment, etc.).  
- **`serialVersionUID`** – Fixed to `1L`, ensuring compatibility across serialized forms.  
- **`ReadableCustomer`** – Represents the customer in a readable form; likely a lightweight DTO mirroring the persistence entity.

### Execution Flow
1. **Instantiation** – When a product review is fetched from the database, a `ReadableProductReview` is created, copying all inherited fields from the entity and populating the `customer` field with a `ReadableCustomer`.  
2. **Serialization** – The object may be serialized (e.g., for HTTP response caching or inter‑service communication).  
3. **Deserialization** – Upon receipt, Java deserialization reconstructs the DTO, including the nested `ReadableCustomer`.

### Assumptions & Constraints
- The parent class (`ProductReviewEntity`) is serializable and contains all required review data.  
- `ReadableCustomer` is also serializable.  
- No validation logic or business rules are enforced at this DTO level.  
- The class relies on standard Java serialization; no external serializers (Jackson, Gson) are referenced.

### Architecture & Design Choices
- **Separation of Concerns** – Keeps persistence entities separate from view‑layer DTOs, preventing accidental exposure of internal fields.  
- **Simplicity** – Only essential fields are present; the design intentionally avoids complex logic to keep DTOs lightweight.

## 3. Functions/Methods

| Method | Description | Parameters | Returns | Side Effects |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------|--------------|
| `public ReadableCustomer getCustomer()` | Accessor for the customer who wrote the review. | – | `ReadableCustomer` instance (may be `null`). | None |
| `public void setCustomer(ReadableCustomer customer)` | Mutator to set the associated customer. | `ReadableCustomer customer` | – | Assigns the provided customer to the internal field. |

*Inherited methods* from `ProductReviewEntity` (e.g., getters/setters for rating, comment, timestamps, ID) are part of the public API but not shown in this file.

## 4. Dependencies

| Library / API | Usage | Type |
|---------------|-------|------|
| `java.io.Serializable` | Marker interface for Java object serialization | Standard |
| `com.salesmanager.shop.model.customer.ReadableCustomer` | Holds customer data for the DTO | Project‑internal |
| `com.salesmanager.shop.model.catalog.product.ProductReviewEntity` | Base entity providing core review fields | Project‑internal |

No third‑party libraries, annotations, or platform‑specific APIs are referenced.

## 5. Additional Notes & Recommendations

### Edge Cases & Potential Issues
- **Null Customer** – The getter may return `null`. Client code should handle this gracefully.  
- **Serialization Compatibility** – With only a single `serialVersionUID`, future changes (e.g., adding fields) might break deserialization. Consider using `@Serial` and explicit versioning strategies if backward compatibility is critical.  
- **Immutability** – Currently mutable; if the DTO is used in a multi‑threaded context or as a cache key, making it immutable could prevent accidental state changes.  
- **Equals / HashCode** – Not overridden. If instances need to be compared or stored in collections, consider implementing these methods based on business keys (e.g., review ID).

### Future Enhancements
1. **JSON Serialization Annotations** – Add Jackson (`@JsonProperty`, `@JsonIgnore`) or similar annotations to control JSON output for REST APIs.  
2. **Validation** – Use Bean Validation (`@NotNull`, `@Size`) if the DTO is populated from external input.  
3. **Conversion Utilities** – Provide static factory methods or mappers (e.g., MapStruct) to convert between `ProductReviewEntity` and `ReadableProductReview`.  
4. **Builder Pattern** – Introduce a builder for fluent construction, especially if more fields are added later.  
5. **Documentation** – Add Javadoc comments to the class and methods for clearer API surface.

Overall, the class is clean and fulfills its role as a lightweight DTO. Minor enhancements around immutability, validation, and serialization control would improve robustness in larger systems.
