# ProductGroup.java

## Review

## 1. Summary
- **Purpose**: The `ProductGroup` class represents a simple data container for product group information within the Sales Manager shop catalog.  
- **Key components**:
  - `code` – a textual identifier for the group.
  - `active` – a boolean flag indicating whether the group is currently active.
  - `id` – a numeric primary key used for persistence or lookup.  
- **Design**: This is a standard Java Bean / POJO with getter/setter pairs, no business logic, and no external frameworks referenced.

---

## 2. Detailed Description
### Core Structure
- **Fields**: Three private fields store the state.
- **Accessors**: Public getter and setter methods expose the fields.
- **Naming**: The class follows conventional Java naming (camelCase for fields, PascalCase for the class name).

### Execution Flow
- **Initialization**: An instance is created via the default constructor (implicitly provided).  
- **Runtime**: The object is typically populated by a service layer or an ORM (e.g., Hibernate/JPA) that sets the values through the setters.  
- **Cleanup**: No special cleanup is required; the class holds only simple data.

### Assumptions & Dependencies
- Assumes the `code` field is non‑null and unique in the broader system context (though this isn’t enforced here).  
- Relies only on the Java SE runtime; no external libraries are referenced.

### Architecture Choices
- The decision to keep this a pure POJO aligns with a layered architecture where domain objects are separated from persistence logic.  
- By providing simple getters/setters, the class remains serializable by frameworks like Jackson or JAXB if needed, though `Serializable` is not explicitly implemented.

## 3. Functions/Methods
| Method | Purpose | Input | Output | Side Effects |
|--------|---------|-------|--------|--------------|
| `public String getCode()` | Retrieve the group's code. | – | `String` code | None |
| `public void setCode(String code)` | Set the group's code. | `String` code | – | Mutates the `code` field |
| `public boolean isActive()` | Check if the group is active. | – | `boolean` active | None |
| `public void setActive(boolean active)` | Mark the group as active/inactive. | `boolean` active | – | Mutates the `active` field |
| `public Long getId()` | Retrieve the group's unique identifier. | – | `Long` id | None |
| `public void setId(Long id)` | Set the group's unique identifier. | `Long` id | – | Mutates the `id` field |

**Reusable / Utility Methods**: None; the class only contains state holders.

---

## 4. Dependencies
| Dependency | Type | Remarks |
|------------|------|---------|
| Java Standard Library (java.lang) | Standard | Used implicitly for `String`, `Boolean`, `Long`. |
| None other | – | No external frameworks or APIs are referenced. |

*Platform‑specific*: The class is platform‑agnostic and should compile on any JVM ≥ Java 8.

## 5. Additional Notes
### Strengths
- **Simplicity**: Clear, easy to understand, minimal boilerplate.  
- **Flexibility**: Can be used in various contexts (DTO, entity, view model) without modification.

### Potential Improvements / Edge Cases
1. **Validation**:  
   - The class currently accepts any value. Adding validation (e.g., non‑empty `code`) would prevent corrupt data.  
   - Consider using annotations (`@NotNull`, `@Size`) if integrating with frameworks like Bean Validation.

2. **Immutability**:  
   - For thread‑safety or value‑object semantics, consider making the class immutable (final fields, no setters).

3. **Equals/HashCode/ToString**:  
   - Overriding these methods can aid debugging, logging, and usage in collections.  
   - Tools like Lombok (`@Data`) can auto‑generate them if desired.

4. **Serializable Interface**:  
   - If the object will be transmitted over a network or stored in HTTP sessions, implementing `Serializable` (or using Java 9+ `record`) could be beneficial.

5. **Javadoc**:  
   - Adding Javadoc comments would improve maintainability and provide better API documentation.

### Future Enhancements
- **Mapping to Entity**: If this class is used as a DTO, a mapper (e.g., MapStruct) can translate between entity and DTO.  
- **Builder Pattern**: Introducing a builder can simplify object creation when many optional fields exist.  
- **Spring Integration**: Annotate with `@Entity` if persistence is required, or `@Component` if used as a Spring bean.

Overall, the class serves its purpose as a straightforward data holder. Enhancements should be driven by how the class is consumed in the larger application stack.

public class ProductGroup {
	
	private String code;
	private boolean active;
	private Long id;
	public String getCode() {
		return code;
	}
	public void setCode(String code) {
		this.code = code;
	}
	public boolean isActive() {
		return active;
	}
	public void setActive(boolean active) {
		this.active = active;
	}
	public Long getId() {
		return id;
	}
	public void setId(Long id) {
		this.id = id;
	}
