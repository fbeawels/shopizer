# ReadablePermission.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
The `ReadablePermission` class is a lightweight Java POJO that extends a base `PermissionEntity`.  Its sole purpose appears to be to mark a permission as *readable* – i.e., a semantic wrapper that could be used for type‑safety or documentation purposes in the security model of the application.  The class currently contains no fields, methods, or logic beyond a `serialVersionUID` declaration, implying that all behaviour is inherited from `PermissionEntity`.

Key points:  
- **Inheritance**: `ReadablePermission` relies entirely on `PermissionEntity` for state and behaviour.  
- **Serialisation**: The presence of `serialVersionUID` suggests the class is intended to be serialisable (likely because `PermissionEntity` implements `Serializable`).  
- **Design pattern**: This is an example of the *Marker* pattern, where an empty subclass is used to indicate a property (here, "readable") without adding new data.

## 2. Detailed Description  
### Core components  
| Component | Role | Interaction |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `ReadablePermission` | A marker subclass that denotes readable permissions | Inherits all fields/methods from `PermissionEntity`; can be used wherever a `PermissionEntity` is accepted, but allows compile‑time discrimination. |
| `PermissionEntity` | Base entity that likely encapsulates permission attributes (id, name, etc.) | Provides the actual data and behaviour; `ReadablePermission` simply extends it. |

### Execution flow  
1. **Instantiation** – The system may instantiate `ReadablePermission` via `new ReadablePermission()` or through a factory/service that returns this type.  
2. **Runtime behaviour** – All methods called on a `ReadablePermission` instance are resolved in `PermissionEntity`. The subclass adds no overrides.  
3. **Persistence** – If `PermissionEntity` is an ORM entity (e.g., JPA), `ReadablePermission` might be persisted as the same database table (single‑table inheritance) or a separate table, depending on the mapping.  
4. **Cleanup** – No specific cleanup; garbage collection handles the object lifecycle.

### Assumptions & constraints  
- `PermissionEntity` implements `Serializable` (hence the `serialVersionUID`).  
- The system uses polymorphism to distinguish readable permissions, perhaps for role‑based access control.  
- No custom constructors or fields are required beyond those inherited.

### Architectural choice  
Using a marker subclass is a simple way to add semantic meaning without modifying the base class. It keeps the type system expressive but increases the number of classes in the codebase. Alternative patterns include an enum or a boolean flag within `PermissionEntity`, which could reduce class proliferation but trade type safety.

---

## 3. Functions/Methods  
The class contains **no** explicit methods; it relies on inherited methods from `PermissionEntity`. If we were to expand it, the following could be useful:

| Method | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Side‑effects |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
| `public ReadablePermission()` | Default constructor | – | New instance | None |
| `public ReadablePermission(…)` (copy or builder) | Convenience constructors | Parameters matching `PermissionEntity` | New instance | None |
| `equals()/hashCode()` | Ensure correct identity semantics | Another object | Boolean / int | None |
| `toString()` | Debug output | – | String | None |

---

## 4. Dependencies  
| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `PermissionEntity` | In‑project | Base class; must be serialisable. |
| Java Standard Library | Standard | `java.io.Serializable`, `java.lang` packages. |
| (Optional) ORM/Annotations | Third‑party | If `PermissionEntity` is a JPA entity, annotations like `@Entity` or `@Table` would be present in that class. |

No external libraries are required by this file alone.

## 5. Additional Notes  

### Edge cases / Limitations  
- **Redundancy**: If no additional behaviour is added, the subclass may be unnecessary; using a flag or enum could be more efficient.  
- **Persistence**: Depending on the ORM strategy (single‑table vs. joined), an empty subclass might still result in a separate table or discriminator column, adding overhead.  
- **Immutability**: Without constructors, the class relies on mutability of `PermissionEntity`. If immutability is desired, consider adding a constructor that accepts all fields.

### Recommendations  
1. **Add documentation** – Explain the purpose of `ReadablePermission` (e.g., “Marker for permissions that can be read by the UI”).  
2. **Provide constructors** – Even a no‑arg constructor can be explicit for clarity.  
3. **Consider alternatives** – If only a boolean flag distinguishes readable permissions, refactor to reduce class count.  
4. **Unit tests** – Verify that a `ReadablePermission` instance behaves identically to a `PermissionEntity` instance and that type checks (e.g., `instanceof`) work as intended.  
5. **Serialization consistency** – Ensure that `serialVersionUID` aligns with the parent class’s expectations if custom serialization logic is present.

By addressing these points, the code will be clearer, more maintainable, and better aligned with Java best practices.
