# ReadableOrderTotal.java

## Review

## 1. Summary

**Purpose & Functionality**  
`ReadableOrderTotal` is a simple Java value object that represents an order’s total amount in a human‑readable form. It extends an existing `OrderTotal` (presumably holding numeric values such as `BigDecimal` for the raw total) and adds:

- A `String` representation of the total (`total`) – useful for UI rendering or JSON output.
- A flag (`discounted`) indicating whether the displayed total has been discounted.

The class is serializable, enabling it to be transmitted over the network, cached, or stored in HTTP sessions.

**Key Components**

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `package com.salesmanager.shop.model.order.total;` | Namespace declaration. |
| `extends OrderTotal` | Inherits base numeric total fields and behaviour. |
| `implements Serializable` | Enables Java serialization. |
| `serialVersionUID` | Explicit UID for serialization compatibility. |
| `private String total` | Human‑readable total string. |
| `private boolean discounted` | Flag indicating discount application. |
| Getters & Setters | Standard JavaBean accessors. |

**Design Patterns / Libraries**  
- The class follows the *Value Object* pattern (immutable state not enforced but semantically intended).  
- No external frameworks or libraries are referenced directly; it relies only on the Java SE `Serializable` interface.

## 2. Detailed Description

### Core Components & Interaction

1. **Inheritance**  
   `ReadableOrderTotal` inherits all fields and methods of `OrderTotal`. The parent likely contains numeric fields such as `BigDecimal amount` and perhaps currency information. By extending, this class can be used wherever an `OrderTotal` is expected while adding UI‑specific information.

2. **Serializable Contract**  
   Declaring `implements Serializable` and providing a `serialVersionUID` ensures that the object can be safely serialized/deserialized across JVM versions. The `serialVersionUID` is set to `1L`, which is a common placeholder but may need revision if the class evolves.

3. **State**  
   - `total` – a textual representation, often formatted according to locale or currency (e.g., `"£12.34"`).  
   - `discounted` – a boolean flag, likely set to `true` when a discount has been applied to the numeric total.

4. **Accessor Methods**  
   Standard getters and setters expose the two fields. No business logic is present; this class is purely a data holder.

### Execution Flow

- **Construction**: No explicit constructor is defined, so the default no‑arg constructor is used. A consumer can instantiate it with `new ReadableOrderTotal()` and then populate the fields via setters or by copying from an `OrderTotal` instance.
- **Runtime**: Objects are typically used as DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) between the backend and the front‑end or serialization layers.
- **Cleanup**: None needed; the object holds only primitive and immutable references.

### Assumptions & Dependencies

- Assumes the parent `OrderTotal` correctly encapsulates numeric total logic.  
- Assumes the `total` string is always consistent with the numeric value in the parent; there is no enforcement or validation logic.  
- Relies on Java SE; no third‑party dependencies.

## 3. Functions/Methods

| Method | Signature | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Side Effects |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
| `getTotal()` | `public String getTotal()` | Retrieve the human‑readable total. | None | `String` value of `total` | None |
| `setTotal(String)` | `public void setTotal(String total)` | Set the human‑readable total. | `String` | None | Mutates `total` field |
| `isDiscounted()` | `public boolean isDiscounted()` | Check if the total has been discounted. | None | `boolean` flag | None |
| `setDiscounted(boolean)` | `public void setDiscounted(boolean discounted)` | Set the discounted flag. | `boolean` | None | Mutates `discounted` field |

**Reusable / Utility Methods**  
There are no additional reusable utilities in this class. It acts purely as a DTO.

## 4. Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `java.io.Serializable` | Standard Java | Enables serialization. |
| `OrderTotal` | Project‑specific | Superclass providing core total logic. |
| `java.lang.String`, `boolean` | Standard Java | Primitive/immutable types. |

No external libraries, frameworks, or APIs are imported. The class is platform‑agnostic within the Java SE ecosystem.

## 5. Additional Notes

### Strengths
- **Simplicity**: Clear intent, minimal boilerplate, easy to instantiate and use.
- **Extensibility**: By extending `OrderTotal`, it can seamlessly integrate where an `OrderTotal` is expected.
- **Serialization**: Explicit `serialVersionUID` aids versioning.

### Potential Issues / Edge Cases
1. **Inconsistency Between Fields**  
   There is no guarantee that the `total` string matches the numeric total in `OrderTotal`. If the parent’s amount changes without updating `total`, the DTO becomes stale.

2. **Immutability**  
   The class is mutable. In multi‑threaded contexts or when used as a key in collections, accidental modifications could lead to bugs. Consider making it immutable or providing a defensive copy mechanism.

3. **Null Handling**  
   `total` can be `null`. Depending on consumers (e.g., JSON serializers), this may cause `NullPointerException` or undesirable output.

4. **Locale / Currency Formatting**  
   The string representation does not enforce locale or currency formatting. The consumer must ensure consistency.

5. **Missing Utility Methods**  
   Overriding `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` would improve debuggability and allow use in collections. As it stands, `Object`’s defaults may not be suitable.

### Suggested Enhancements
- **Immutable DTO**: Provide a constructor that sets all fields and remove setters.  
- **Validation**: Add checks in setters or constructor to ensure `total` is not `null` and matches the parent’s numeric total.  
- **Utility Overrides**: Implement `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` (or use Lombok’s `@Value` / `@Data` annotations).  
- **Builder Pattern**: If many fields are added in future, a builder can simplify construction.  
- **Documentation**: JavaDoc comments for the class and methods would improve maintainability.  
- **Unit Tests**: Simple tests verifying that the DTO retains the correct state after construction and mutation.

---

**Overall Assessment**  
`ReadableOrderTotal` is a lightweight DTO that cleanly extends a core domain object to add UI‑friendly data. While functionally adequate for simple scenarios, it would benefit from immutability, consistency checks, and richer object semantics to avoid subtle bugs in larger systems.

## Code Critique



## Code Preview

```java
package com.salesmanager.shop.model.order.total;

import java.io.Serializable;

public class ReadableOrderTotal extends OrderTotal implements Serializable {

	/**
	 * 
	 */
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	private String total;
	private boolean discounted;
	public String getTotal() {
		return total;
	}
	public void setTotal(String total) {
		this.total = total;
	}
	public boolean isDiscounted() {
		return discounted;
	}
	public void setDiscounted(boolean discounted) {
		this.discounted = discounted;
	}

}
