# ReadableOrder.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
**Purpose** – `ReadableOrder` is a *view‑model* (DTO) used by the **SalesManager** front‑end layer to expose order data in a human‑readable format.  
It wraps an internal `Order` entity (inherited) and augments it with nested “read‑only” value objects that represent the billing address, delivery address, shipping option, payment details, total cost and the list of ordered products.  

**Key components**  
| Class | Role |
|-------|------|
| `ReadableBilling` | DTO for the billing address |
| `ReadableDelivery` | DTO for the delivery address |
| `ShippingOption` | Domain entity that contains shipping method/price |
| `ReadablePayment` | DTO for payment information |
| `ReadableTotal` | DTO for the computed total amounts |
| `ReadableOrderProduct` | DTO for an individual product line |
| `Order` | The base entity that holds the raw persistence data |

The design follows a **DTO / Value‑Object** pattern – each nested DTO is a *read‑only* representation of a domain object.  The class is plain Java (POJO) and relies only on standard Java serialization.

---

## 2. Detailed Description  
1. **Inheritance** – `ReadableOrder` extends `Order`.  It inherits all persistent fields (id, status, timestamps, etc.) and simply adds extra fields that are useful for API output.

2. **Field composition** –  
   * `billing`, `delivery`, `payment`, `total`, `shippingOption` are single‑value objects.  
   * `products` is a `List<ReadableOrderProduct>` representing the order line‑items.

3. **Execution Flow**  
   * **Construction** – No explicit constructor is defined, so the default no‑arg constructor is used.  A client (e.g. a service layer or mapper) populates the inherited fields from the persistence `Order` and then calls the setter methods to inject the DTOs.  
   * **Runtime behaviour** – The class is *purely data*.  No business logic lives inside it; it only holds state.  It can be serialised to JSON (via Jackson, GSON, etc.) for API responses.  
   * **Cleanup** – None required.  When the object is no longer referenced, the GC will reclaim it.

4. **Assumptions & Dependencies**  
   * `Order` implements `Serializable` (implied by the `serialVersionUID`), so `ReadableOrder` can be serialised.  
   * The DTOs (`ReadableBilling`, `ReadableDelivery`, etc.) are simple Java classes with their own getters/setters.  
   * No external frameworks are used in this file – the code relies on the standard Java API.

5. **Architecture & Design Choices**  
   * **Explicit DTOs** – Instead of exposing the entity directly, a dedicated read‑only model keeps API contracts stable.  
   * **Mutable fields** – The class uses standard setters; it is not immutable.  This simplifies mapping from domain objects but can lead to accidental mutation if the instance is shared.  
   * **Versioned package** – `com.salesmanager.shop.model.order.v1` indicates a versioned API; future iterations can introduce a `v2` with different shape.

## 3. Functions/Methods  
| Method | Parameters | Return | Purpose | Side‑effects |
|--------|------------|--------|---------|--------------|
| `getProducts()` | – | `List<ReadableOrderProduct>` | Retrieve the list of order line‑items. | None |
| `setProducts(List<ReadableOrderProduct>)` | `products` | `void` | Replace the current list of products. | Mutates `products` field |
| `getDelivery()` | – | `ReadableDelivery` | Get the delivery address DTO. | None |
| `setDelivery(ReadableDelivery)` | `delivery` | `void` | Set the delivery address. | Mutates `delivery` |
| `getPayment()` | – | `ReadablePayment` | Get the payment DTO. | None |
| `setPayment(ReadablePayment)` | `payment` | `void` | Set the payment information. | Mutates `payment` |
| `getTotal()` | – | `ReadableTotal` | Get the total amounts DTO. | None |
| `setTotal(ReadableTotal)` | `total` | `void` | Set the total DTO. | Mutates `total` |
| `getShippingOption()` | – | `ShippingOption` | Get the shipping option. | None |
| `setShippingOption(ShippingOption)` | `shippingOption` | `void` | Set the shipping option. | Mutates `shippingOption` |
| `getBilling()` | – | `ReadableBilling` | Get the billing address DTO. | None |
| `setBilling(ReadableBilling)` | `billing` | `void` | Set the billing address. | Mutates `billing` |

> **Reusable utilities** – The class only contains getters/setters; there are no generic helper methods.  All state mutation is explicit through setters.

## 4. Dependencies  
| Library | Type | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Java Standard Library (`java.util.List`) | Standard | Basic collection |
| `ShippingOption` | Domain entity | Comes from `com.salesmanager.core.model.shipping` |
| DTOs (`ReadableBilling`, `ReadableDelivery`, `ReadablePayment`, `ReadableTotal`, `ReadableOrderProduct`) | Domain‑specific | Part of the same project, not third‑party |
| `Order` (parent class) | Domain entity | Provides core order fields and serialization |

There are **no third‑party or platform‑specific dependencies** in this file.  If the project uses Jackson or GSON for JSON mapping, the annotations are absent here – they may be added on the DTOs instead.

## 5. Additional Notes & Recommendations  

### 5.1. Immutability  
*The class is currently mutable.*  
If the DTO is only ever used for *output* (e.g. returned by REST controllers), consider making it **immutable**:
* Use a constructor that takes all fields.  
* Remove all setters.  
* Wrap the `List<ReadableOrderProduct>` with `Collections.unmodifiableList`.  
* This prevents accidental modification after mapping.

### 5.2. Equality & Hashing  
The class overrides nothing.  
If `ReadableOrder` instances are compared (e.g. in tests or caching), consider overriding `equals()` and `hashCode()` to include the DTO fields.  Using Lombok’s `@Data` or `@Value` would auto‑generate these methods.

### 5.3. Validation  
No validation is performed on the DTO fields.  
* If null values are not acceptable, add checks in setters or in the constructor.  
* Alternatively, use bean‑validation annotations (`@NotNull`, `@Size`) if the project supports it.

### 5.4. Documentation  
* The class has a trivial javadoc comment (`/** */`).  
* Adding a class‑level Javadoc that describes its role, usage, and any constraints would improve maintainability.

### 5.5. Mapping Strategy  
The current approach requires manually setting each field.  
* **MapStruct** or a similar mapper can automatically copy properties from the domain `Order` to `ReadableOrder`, reducing boilerplate.  
* Consider adding a static factory method:  
  ```java
  public static ReadableOrder from(Order order, ReadableBilling billing, …) { … }
  ```

### 5.6. API Versioning  
The package suffix `v1` hints at potential future API changes.  
* When introducing a new version, the DTO can evolve without breaking existing clients.  
* Document the differences in the API spec (OpenAPI, Swagger).

### 5.7. Edge Cases  
* **Null `products`** – Returning `null` can lead to `NullPointerException` on the client side.  Prefer an empty list (`Collections.emptyList()`).
* **Large product lists** – If pagination is required, the DTO may need to carry paging metadata.

### 5.8. Future Enhancements  
* Add a `Map<String, Object> customAttributes` field for extensible order data.  
* Introduce a builder pattern (`ReadableOrder.Builder`) to simplify object creation.  
* Provide a `toMap()` helper for quick JSON serialization when a generic format is needed.

---

### Verdict  
`ReadableOrder` is a clean, straightforward DTO that correctly separates presentation data from the persistence layer.  The main improvement area is **immutability & validation** to avoid accidental state changes, plus adding richer documentation and equality semantics.  With these tweaks, the class will be more robust, easier to test, and ready for future API evolution.
