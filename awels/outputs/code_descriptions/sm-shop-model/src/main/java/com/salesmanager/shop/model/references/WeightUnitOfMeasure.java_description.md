# WeightUnitOfMeasure.java

## Review

## 1. Summary
- **Purpose**:  
  The file defines a simple Java `enum` called `WeightUnitOfMeasure` that enumerates common units of weight and volume used in a retail or e‑commerce context.
- **Key Components**:  
  - The enum constants: `g`, `kg`, `l`, `lb`, `T`.  
  - No methods or additional fields are declared.
- **Design Patterns / Libraries**:  
  This is a straightforward use of the Java `enum` type; no external frameworks or design patterns are involved.

---

## 2. Detailed Description
- **Structure**:  
  The enum is declared inside the package `com.salesmanager.shop.model.references`, implying it is part of a model layer used by the shop’s business logic.  
- **Execution Flow**:  
  Enums in Java are initialized statically when the class loader loads the class. Each constant (`g`, `kg`, etc.) is a singleton instance of `WeightUnitOfMeasure`. There is no runtime logic beyond the default constructor that Java supplies for enums.
- **Assumptions & Constraints**:  
  - The enum assumes that these five units cover the required business domain; any additional units would require enum extension.  
  - The enum names are in lowercase (`g`, `kg`, `l`, `lb`) except for `T` which is uppercase. The inconsistency may lead to confusion or accidental misuse.
- **Architecture**:  
  As a plain enum, it serves as a type-safe constant holder. Other domain classes (e.g., product, inventory) likely reference this enum to express unit of measure. No persistence or serialization logic is embedded here; such concerns would be handled elsewhere (e.g., JPA converters, JSON adapters).

## 3. Functions/Methods
The enum contains no explicit methods; however, it inherits the following from `java.lang.Enum`:

| Method | Purpose | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `name()` | Returns the identifier of the enum constant (e.g., `"g"`). | Immutable, no side‑effects. |
| `ordinal()` | Returns the constant’s position in its declaration (0‑based). | Use with caution – ordering may change if enum is modified. |
| `valueOf(String)` | Static factory to obtain an enum constant by name. | Throws `IllegalArgumentException` if name not found. |
| `values()` | Returns an array of all constants. | Useful for iteration. |

No custom utility methods are present; if needed (e.g., converting to a symbol or display string), they would be added here.

## 4. Dependencies
| Category | Dependency | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Standard Java | `java.lang.Enum` | Built into the JDK; no external libraries. |
| Packaging | `com.salesmanager.shop.model.references` | The package structure indicates integration with the larger SalesManager application. |

No third‑party libraries or external APIs are used in this file.

## 5. Additional Notes
### 5.1 Naming Consistency
- The enum constants are a mix of lower‑case and upper‑case (`T`). For readability and to avoid accidental typos, it is recommended to standardise the naming convention, e.g., `t` for ton or `ton` for clarity.
- Alternatively, if `T` represents a specific type (e.g., *Metric Ton*), consider renaming to `METRIC_TON` to follow typical enum naming conventions (all caps, underscores).

### 5.2 Documentation
- The block comment briefly lists the units but doesn’t explain why each is included or how they map to physical measurements. Adding Javadoc comments for each constant (or for the enum itself) would improve maintainability.

### 5.3 Extensibility
- If the application needs to support other measurement units (e.g., `oz`, `st`, `kgf`, `ml`), the enum should be expanded accordingly.  
- For conversion between units (e.g., grams to kilograms), a helper method or separate converter class would be beneficial.

### 5.4 Serialization
- When persisting this enum (e.g., in a database or sending over a REST API), consider using a string representation that aligns with business rules. JPA’s `@Enumerated` or Jackson’s annotations could be used if integration is required.

### 5.5 Potential Enhancements
1. **Display Strings**:  
   ```java
   private final String display;
   WeightUnitOfMeasure(String display) { this.display = display; }
   public String getDisplay() { return display; }
   ```
   This would allow UI components to display user‑friendly names.

2. **Conversion Logic**:  
   A static method that accepts two enum values and performs unit conversion (perhaps delegating to a library like Units of Measurement API).

3. **Unit Validation**:  
   A static `isValid(String)` method to validate incoming strings before converting to the enum, guarding against `IllegalArgumentException`.

4. **Internationalization**:  
   Map each constant to a localized string resource.

### 5.6 Edge Cases
- The current enum does not handle case sensitivity in `valueOf`. Clients must pass the exact constant name. Adding a case‑insensitive lookup could improve usability.
- The enum mixes weight and volume (`l` stands for liter, a volume unit). If the application distinguishes weight from volume, consider separating them into different enums or adding a property indicating the type.

```java
package com.salesmanager.shop.model.references;

public enum WeightUnitOfMeasure {
  /*
   * g = grams
   * kg = kilograms
   * l = liter
   * lb = pound
   * T = ton
   */
  g, kg, l, lb, T

}
