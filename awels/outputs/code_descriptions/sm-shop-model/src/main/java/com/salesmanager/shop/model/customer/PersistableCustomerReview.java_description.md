# PersistableCustomerReview.java

## Review

## 1. Summary
- **Purpose**: `PersistableCustomerReview` is a lightweight Java POJO that represents a customer review that can be persisted (most likely via JPA/Hibernate). It extends a base entity `CustomerReviewEntity` and simply adds a `reviewedCustomer` identifier.
- **Key components**:
  - `serialVersionUID` – standard for a `Serializable` entity.
  - `reviewedCustomer` – a `Long` holding the ID of the customer being reviewed.
  - Standard getter/setter for `reviewedCustomer`.
- **Design patterns / libraries**: The class follows the *Entity* pattern common in ORM frameworks. No external frameworks or annotations are used in the snippet itself, but the parent `CustomerReviewEntity` almost certainly defines JPA annotations.

## 2. Detailed Description
1. **Inheritance**  
   The class extends `CustomerReviewEntity`, inheriting all fields/methods defined there (likely includes review text, rating, timestamps, etc.). By extending, it keeps the persistence mapping in the base class while adding a single new column.

2. **Execution flow**  
   - **Construction**: The class relies on the default no‑arg constructor supplied by Java (not explicitly defined). For JPA, a public no‑arg constructor is required; if `CustomerReviewEntity` already provides one, this class inherits it.  
   - **Runtime usage**:  
     - A developer or service layer populates the entity (e.g., `reviewedCustomer = 42L`).  
     - Persistence provider (JPA/Hibernate) reads the getter/setter to write the value to the database.  
   - **Serialization**: The presence of `serialVersionUID` indicates that the object may be serialized (e.g., cached or sent over the network).  

3. **Assumptions & constraints**  
   - `reviewedCustomer` is a foreign key to a `Customer` entity; the code assumes that the ID is a `Long`.  
   - No validation is performed; the field can be `null` or negative.  
   - The entity likely participates in a bi‑directional relationship; mapping annotations are probably on the parent.

4. **Architecture choice**  
   Using inheritance for a single additional column is simple but can become fragile if the base entity grows. A *composition* approach (embedding a reference instead of extending) could increase flexibility and avoid potential JPA mapping clashes.

## 3. Functions/Methods
| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Returns | Side Effects |
|--------|---------|------------|---------|--------------|
| `public PersistableCustomerReview()` | Implicit no‑arg constructor (inherited) | – | – | Creates a new instance with default values. |
| `public Long getReviewedCustomer()` | Accessor for the reviewed customer ID | – | `Long` | None |
| `public void setReviewedCustomer(Long reviewedCustomer)` | Mutator for the reviewed customer ID | `Long reviewedCustomer` | – | Updates the internal field |

*Reusable utilities*: None in this snippet. The class could benefit from overriding `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()` for debugging and collections handling.

---

## 4. Dependencies
| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `CustomerReviewEntity` | Parent class (likely JPA entity) | Defines primary key, timestamps, review content, etc. |
| `java.io.Serializable` | Standard | Inherited via the parent; `serialVersionUID` is used. |
| JPA/Hibernate annotations (e.g., `@Entity`, `@Column`) | Third‑party (via JPA spec) | Not present in this snippet but probably defined in the base class. |

No explicit platform‑specific code is visible; the class should run on any JVM supporting Java SE 8+ and the chosen ORM provider.

## 5. Additional Notes & Recommendations
### Edge Cases / Potential Issues
- **Null or Invalid ID**: The setter accepts any `Long`. An external caller could pass `null` or a negative value, leading to orphaned references or DB constraints violations.
- **Serialization Compatibility**: Changing the base class without updating the `serialVersionUID` could break deserialization. Keep the UID in sync with any structural changes.
- **JPA Mapping Ambiguity**: Since this class adds a field without annotations, mapping is implicit. If the parent uses `@AttributeOverrides` or `@Column` naming conventions, this may work fine, but explicit annotations (`@Column(name="reviewed_customer_id")`) would make the mapping clearer.
- **Inheritance vs. Composition**: If `CustomerReviewEntity` becomes more complex, a separate association class or a `@ManyToOne` relationship may be preferable.

### Suggested Enhancements
1. **Explicit JPA Mapping**  
   ```java
   @Column(name = "reviewed_customer_id", nullable = false)
   private Long reviewedCustomer;
   ```

2. **Validation**  
   ```java
   public void setReviewedCustomer(Long reviewedCustomer) {
       Objects.requireNonNull(reviewedCustomer, "Reviewed customer ID cannot be null");
       if (reviewedCustomer <= 0) {
           throw new IllegalArgumentException("Reviewed customer ID must be positive");
       }
       this.reviewedCustomer = reviewedCustomer;
   }
   ```

3. **Utility Methods**  
   - Override `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()` based on the primary key and `reviewedCustomer`.  
   - Add a `toDTO()` helper if this entity is exposed via REST.

4. **Documentation**  
   - Add Javadoc comments explaining the purpose of the field and any constraints.  
   - If this entity is part of a public API, consider annotating it with Swagger annotations.

5. **Unit Tests**  
   - Simple tests to ensure getters/setters work and that validation triggers correctly.

6. **Immutability (Optional)**  
   If reviews should not change once persisted, make the class immutable: provide all fields via constructor and remove setters. JPA can handle immutable entities with `@Immutable`.

7. **Consistency with Parent**  
   - Verify that the parent class defines `equals`/`hashCode` based on the surrogate key; if not, override in this subclass accordingly.

By addressing these points, the `PersistableCustomerReview` will become more robust, maintainable, and easier to understand for developers working on the persistence layer.

public class PersistableCustomerReview extends CustomerReviewEntity {
	
	/**
	 *

	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	private Long reviewedCustomer;

	public Long getReviewedCustomer() {
		return reviewedCustomer;
	}

	public void setReviewedCustomer(Long reviewedCustomer) {
		this.reviewedCustomer = reviewedCustomer;
	}
