# ShippingFacade.java

## Review

## 1. Summary

This Java interface defines the contract for a **Shipping Facade** that mediates between the web/shop layer and the underlying shipping domain.  
It encapsulates all shipping‑related operations that a merchant store can perform:

| Category | Responsibility |
|----------|----------------|
| **Configuration** | Retrieve and persist expedition configuration (`ExpeditionConfiguration`). |
| **Origin** | Fetch and store the store’s shipping origin address. |
| **Package management** | Create, read, update, and delete `PackageDetails` objects. |
| **Country support** | Provide a list of countries that the store can ship to. |

Key points:

- The interface uses **Domain Models** (`MerchantStore`, `Language`, `PackageDetails`, etc.) from the core module, indicating a clean separation between the shop layer and the core business logic.
- No implementation is shown, but the design follows a **Facade** pattern: a simplified API over potentially complex shipping services.
- The naming convention is consistent (`get`, `save`, `create`, `update`, `delete`) which aids readability.

## 2. Detailed Description

### Core Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `MerchantStore` | Represents the store context (store ID, name, etc.). All methods are scoped to a particular store. |
| `Language` | Provides localisation for textual data (e.g., country names). |
| `ExpeditionConfiguration` | Holds store‑specific shipping configuration such as carrier settings, rates, or rules. |
| `PersistableAddress` / `ReadableAddress` | Two representations of an address: one for persisting (likely includes raw fields) and one for reading (perhaps enriched with formatted text). |
| `ReadableCountry` | Read‑only representation of a country, probably containing code, name, and whether it’s enabled for shipping. |
| `PackageDetails` | Describes a shipping package – weight, dimensions, cod, etc. |

### Flow of Execution

1. **Initialization** – The application layer (e.g., a controller) obtains an instance of a class implementing `ShippingFacade`.  
2. **Configuration** – `getExpeditionConfiguration` fetches current settings; `saveExpeditionConfiguration` persists changes.  
3. **Origin Management** – `getShippingOrigin` returns the default origin address; `saveShippingOrigin` updates it.  
4. **Package Lifecycle** –  
   - `createPackage` creates a new package record.  
   - `getPackage` retrieves details by code.  
   - `updatePackage` modifies an existing package.  
   - `deletePackage` removes it.  
   - `listPackages` lists all packages for the store.  
5. **Country Support** – `shipToCountry` returns the list of countries that the store is configured to ship to, respecting the supplied language.

### Assumptions & Constraints

- **Store Context**: Every operation requires a non‑null `MerchantStore`. The implementation must validate this precondition.  
- **Language**: Methods that involve localisation (`shipToCountry`) accept a `Language`. It’s assumed that this language is supported by the store.  
- **Persistence**: The interface abstracts persistence; the underlying implementation may use JPA, JDBC, or an external API.  
- **Uniqueness**: Package codes are presumed unique per store. The contract does not specify error handling but implementations should throw exceptions for duplicates or missing records.  

### Design Choices

- **Facade Pattern**: By exposing a single interface, the rest of the application is insulated from the complexity of shipping integration (multiple carriers, APIs, etc.).  
- **Separation of Concerns**: Shipping configuration, origin address, and package handling are grouped logically within the same facade, keeping the API surface small yet comprehensive.  
- **Read/Write Splitting**: Distinguishes between persistable and readable representations of addresses, which can help prevent accidental modification of read‑only data.

## 3. Functions/Methods

| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Return | Side‑Effects |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|--------------|
| `ExpeditionConfiguration getExpeditionConfiguration(MerchantStore store, Language language)` | Retrieve the current shipping configuration for a store. | `store`: context; `language`: localisation. | The configuration object. | None. |
| `void saveExpeditionConfiguration(ExpeditionConfiguration expedition, MerchantStore store)` | Persist a new/updated configuration. | `expedition`: configuration to save; `store`: context. | None. | Writes to storage. |
| `ReadableAddress getShippingOrigin(MerchantStore store)` | Get the default shipping origin address. | `store`: context. | Read‑only address. | None. |
| `void saveShippingOrigin(PersistableAddress address, MerchantStore store)` | Persist or update the shipping origin. | `address`: address to save; `store`: context. | None. | Writes to storage. |
| `void createPackage(PackageDetails packaging, MerchantStore store)` | Create a new package record. | `packaging`: package details; `store`: context. | None. | Inserts into storage. |
| `PackageDetails getPackage(String code, MerchantStore store)` | Retrieve package by its code. | `code`: unique identifier; `store`: context. | The package details. | None. |
| `List<ReadableCountry> shipToCountry(MerchantStore store, Language lanuage)` | List countries the store can ship to, localised. | `store`: context; `lanuage`: language (note typo). | List of countries. | None. |
| `List<PackageDetails> listPackages(MerchantStore store)` | List all packages for a store. | `store`: context. | List of package details. | None. |
| `void updatePackage(String code, PackageDetails packaging, MerchantStore store)` | Update an existing package. | `code`: package identifier; `packaging`: new details; `store`: context. | None. | Updates storage. |
| `void deletePackage(String code, MerchantStore store)` | Delete a package. | `code`: package identifier; `store`: context. | None. | Removes from storage. |

**Reusable/Utility methods** – The interface itself does not provide utilities, but the separation into persistable vs readable types encourages reuse of those DTOs across the application.

## 4. Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.merchant.MerchantStore` | Core domain | Represents store metadata; likely a JPA entity. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.reference.language.Language` | Core domain | Handles localisation; may map to a language table. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.shipping.PackageDetails` | Core domain | Holds package metrics; probably a JPA entity. |
| `com.salesmanager.shop.model.references.PersistableAddress` | Shop DTO | Read‑write address representation. |
| `com.salesmanager.shop.model.references.ReadableAddress` | Shop DTO | Read‑only address representation. |
| `com.salesmanager.shop.model.references.ReadableCountry` | Shop DTO | Read‑only country representation. |
| `com.salesmanager.shop.model.shipping.ExpeditionConfiguration` | Shop DTO | Shipping config representation. |

All dependencies are internal to the *SalesManager* product, meaning no external libraries are required by this interface alone. However, any concrete implementation will likely need Spring, JPA, or an HTTP client.

## 5. Additional Notes

### Strengths
- **Clear API surface** – The methods are self‑describing, making the facade intuitive for developers.  
- **Extensibility** – Adding new shipping features (e.g., tracking) can be done by extending the interface or adding new methods without breaking existing clients.  
- **Decoupling** – The shop layer is decoupled from core domain persistence; this aligns with Domain‑Driven Design principles.

### Potential Issues & Edge Cases
1. **Parameter Validation** – The interface does not mandate null checks. Implementations should enforce non‑null parameters, especially `store`.  
2. **Language Typo** – `shipToCountry` declares `Language lanuage`. The misspelling may propagate to implementation classes and cause confusion or compilation errors if not corrected.  
3. **Error Handling** – No exception types are specified. It would be beneficial to define a custom `ShippingException` hierarchy for clarity.  
4. **Concurrency** – Multiple threads modifying the same package or configuration concurrently could lead to race conditions; the implementation must handle synchronization or optimistic locking.  
5. **Performance** – `listPackages` and `shipToCountry` may return large lists; consider pagination or filtering in future enhancements.  

### Future Enhancements
- **Pagination & Filtering** – Add methods such as `listPackages(Pageable pageable)` or `shipToCountry(MerchantStore store, Language language, Predicate filter)`.  
- **Eventing** – Emit events on configuration changes or package updates to allow downstream services (e.g., notification or analytics).  
- **Batch Operations** – Bulk create/update/delete packages to reduce round‑trips.  
- **Validation Annotations** – Use Hibernate Validator annotations on DTOs to enforce business rules.  
- **API Documentation** – Generate Javadoc or Swagger annotations for implementations to aid API consumers.  

Overall, the interface is well‑structured, concise, and aligned with best practices for service facades. The primary focus for the implementation should be robust validation, clear error handling, and adherence to the expected contracts illustrated here.
