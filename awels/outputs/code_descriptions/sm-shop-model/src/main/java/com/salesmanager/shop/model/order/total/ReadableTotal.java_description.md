# ReadableTotal.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
`ReadableTotal` is a **plain‑old Java object (POJO)** that represents the summary of an order’s total.  
* **Purpose** – Holds a list of individual line totals (`ReadableOrderTotal`) and a string representation of the overall grand total.  
* **Key components**  
  * `List<ReadableOrderTotal> totals` – the breakdown of individual cost components.  
  * `String grandTotal` – the aggregated amount shown to the user.  
  * Standard `Serializable` implementation with a `serialVersionUID`.  
* **Design notes** – The class is deliberately lightweight; no business logic or state‑changing methods are present. No external frameworks or patterns are used beyond the Java core libraries.

## 2. Detailed Description  
### Structure  
| Element | Type | Visibility | Role |
|---------|------|------------|------|
| `serialVersionUID` | `long` | `static final` | Serialization compatibility marker. |
| `totals` | `List<ReadableOrderTotal>` | `private` | Stores each cost line (tax, shipping, discounts, etc.). |
| `grandTotal` | `String` | `private` | The formatted total shown to the user. |

### Execution Flow  
* **Initialization** – The class relies on the default no‑arg constructor (implicitly provided).  
* **Runtime behaviour** – Clients simply call the getters/setters to populate or read the data.  
* **Cleanup** – As a pure data holder there is no resource cleanup.

### Assumptions & Constraints  
* The `grandTotal` is treated as a **string**; the class does not enforce any numeric format or locale.  
* The list of totals may be `null` or empty; no defensive copying is performed.  
* The class is **mutable**; external code can alter the list or the grand total at any time.

### Architecture & Design Choices  
The decision to keep the class immutable would improve safety, but the current mutable design allows easy integration with serialization frameworks (Jackson, GSON) that often rely on getters/setters. The use of `Serializable` suggests that instances might be stored in HTTP sessions or transmitted over RMI.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Signature | Purpose | Inputs | Output | Side‑Effects |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------|--------|--------------|
| `getTotals()` | `public List<ReadableOrderTotal> getTotals()` | Retrieve the list of line totals. | None | The current list (may be `null`). | None |
| `setTotals(List<ReadableOrderTotal> totals)` | `public void setTotals(List<ReadableOrderTotal> totals)` | Replace the list of line totals. | `List<ReadableOrderTotal>` | None | Mutates internal state |
| `getGrandTotal()` | `public String getGrandTotal()` | Retrieve the formatted grand total. | None | `String` | None |
| `setGrandTotal(String grandTotal)` | `public void setGrandTotal(String grandTotal)` | Set the formatted grand total. | `String` | None | Mutates internal state |

*No additional helper or utility methods are present.*

## 4. Dependencies  

| Library | Version | Category | Notes |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| `java.io.Serializable` | Standard Java | Core | Required for Java serialization. |
| `java.util.List` | Standard Java | Core | Generic collection for totals. |

There are **no third‑party or framework dependencies**. The class is pure Java.

## 5. Additional Notes  

### Strengths  
* **Simplicity** – Easy to instantiate, serialize, and integrate into larger data models.  
* **Clear intent** – Field names and documentation convey purpose without ambiguity.

### Weaknesses / Edge Cases  
1. **Numeric Precision** – `String grandTotal` does not guarantee correct monetary formatting or rounding. Using `BigDecimal` (or a dedicated Money type) would provide precision and easier arithmetic.  
2. **Immutability** – The mutable nature invites accidental modification; defensive copies or an immutable builder could mitigate this.  
3. **Null Handling** – Getters return raw references; callers must guard against `NullPointerException`.  
4. **No Validation** – The class does not enforce that the sum of `totals` equals `grandTotal`, leaving consistency to external logic.

### Potential Enhancements  
* **Immutability** – Add a constructor that accepts the list and grand total, then expose read‑only access.  
* **Typed Monetary Values** – Replace `String` with a numeric type (e.g., `BigDecimal`) and add formatting utilities.  
* **Equality & Hashing** – Override `equals()` and `hashCode()` if instances will be compared or stored in collections.  
* **Serialization Annotations** – If using JSON frameworks, annotate fields with `@JsonProperty` or equivalent for clarity.  
* **Validation Layer** – Provide a method to verify that `grandTotal` equals the sum of `totals`.  

Overall, `ReadableTotal` serves its purpose as a lightweight DTO. Addressing the points above would improve robustness, maintainability, and correctness, especially in a production environment where monetary values and immutability are critical.
