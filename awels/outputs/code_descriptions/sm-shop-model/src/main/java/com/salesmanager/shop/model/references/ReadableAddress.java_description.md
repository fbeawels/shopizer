# ReadableAddress.java

## Review

## 1. Summary
- **Purpose**: `ReadableAddress` is a placeholder subclass of `Address`. Its only explicit declaration is a `serialVersionUID` field, implying that the class is intended to be serializable and to serve as a lightweight, possibly immutable representation of an address for client‑side or API use.
- **Key Components**:  
  - Extends the domain model `Address`.  
  - Declares a `serialVersionUID` for Java serialization compatibility.
- **Design Notes**: The file is minimal, suggesting that any additional behavior or data is inherited from `Address`. No patterns or frameworks are explicitly invoked here.

## 2. Detailed Description
1. **Inheritance**  
   - `ReadableAddress` inherits all fields, constructors, and methods of `Address`.  
   - It does **not** override or add any functionality; it simply provides a distinct type.

2. **Serialization**  
   - The `serialVersionUID` guarantees a stable serialization identifier across different releases.  
   - Because `Address` already implements `Serializable`, this subclass automatically becomes serializable as well.

3. **Execution Flow**  
   - **Initialization**: When a `ReadableAddress` instance is created, the constructor chain starts at `Object` → `Address` → `ReadableAddress`.  
   - **Runtime**: No additional logic is executed beyond what `Address` defines.  
   - **Cleanup**: None required.

4. **Assumptions & Constraints**  
   - Assumes `Address` is serializable and that its fields are compatible with the intended use case.  
   - No constraints on immutability; the subclass inherits whatever mutability the base class offers.  
   - Relies on the presence of `Address` in the same package or accessible via imports.

5. **Architecture**  
   - The design follows a classic “marker” or “type‑separating” approach: creating a distinct subclass to signal a different use‑case (e.g., a read‑only view or DTO) without altering the base class.  
   - No additional interfaces or composition are employed.

## 3. Functions/Methods
The class contains **no explicit methods** beyond what it inherits. The sole element is:

| Member | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `serialVersionUID` | `static final long` | Provides a consistent identifier for Java serialization. |

> **Note**: Any public, protected, or package‑private methods that exist in `Address` are implicitly available here.

## 4. Dependencies
| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `Address` | Internal (project) | Base class that defines the address structure. |
| `Serializable` (via `Address`) | Java Standard Library | Enables object serialization. |
| None else | | No external libraries or frameworks are referenced. |

## 5. Additional Notes
- **Missing Documentation**: The class has no Javadoc comments explaining its intent or differences from `Address`. Adding a brief description would improve maintainability.
- **Immutability**: If the goal is to provide a read‑only representation, consider either:
  - Overriding mutator methods (e.g., `setStreet()`) to throw `UnsupportedOperationException`.
  - Making `ReadableAddress` immutable by declaring final fields or providing a constructor that copies the state.
- **Equality & Hashing**: If `ReadableAddress` is used in collections or as keys, ensure that `equals()` and `hashCode()` are consistent with `Address` or explicitly override them if necessary.
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Add validation or formatting logic specific to the “readable” use case (e.g., pretty‑printing address lines).
  - Introduce a builder or factory to construct `ReadableAddress` instances from `Address` objects, ensuring any transformations are centralized.
  - If serialization is required for distributed systems, consider using a more robust mechanism (e.g., Jackson DTOs) rather than raw Java serialization.

In summary, `ReadableAddress` currently serves as a thin marker subclass. While functional, it would benefit from explicit documentation, potential immutability safeguards, and clearer intent documentation.
