# OrderProduct.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
**Purpose & Scope**  
The `OrderProduct` class represents a single product line item within an order in the SalesManager shop domain. It stores minimal state (the SKU of the product) and inherits common entity behavior from `Entity`.  

**Key Components**  
| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `OrderProduct` | Data transfer object (DTO) that holds SKU information for an order line item. |
| `Entity` | Base class (not shown) that likely provides an `id`, timestamps, or persistence hooks. |
| `Serializable` | Enables the object to be serialized for caching, transmission, or storage. |

**Design Patterns & Frameworks**  
- Plain Old Java Object (POJO) pattern for DTOs.  
- Likely used with an ORM or messaging system that requires serializable domain objects.  
- No explicit design patterns (e.g., Builder, Factory) are used here, reflecting the class’s simple structure.

## 2. Detailed Description  
### Core Interaction Flow  
1. **Construction** – An instance of `OrderProduct` is created (either directly or via a factory).  
2. **Population** – The `sku` field is set through `setSku()` or during construction.  
3. **Persistence / Transfer** – The object may be persisted by an ORM, sent over a REST API, or cached.  
4. **Deserialization** – When retrieved from a stream or database, the class is reconstructed via the default Java serialization mechanism.

### Architecture & Design Choices  
- **Extending `Entity`**: This suggests a shared contract (e.g., `id`, `createdDate`, `updatedDate`). By inheriting, all entities maintain consistent metadata.  
- **`Serializable`**: Adding this flag allows easy integration with frameworks that rely on Java serialization, such as HTTP sessions or remote messaging.  
- **Single Field**: The class currently holds only `sku`. This keeps the DTO lightweight but may limit expressiveness; typical order line items contain quantity, price, discount, etc.

### Assumptions & Constraints  
- The `sku` value is expected to be non‑null and unique per product.  
- No validation logic is present; callers must enforce data integrity.  
- The `Entity` base class is presumed to provide required lifecycle hooks or identification.

## 3. Functions/Methods  
| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Returns | Side‑Effects |
|--------|---------|------------|---------|--------------|
| `public OrderProduct()` | Default constructor (implicitly provided). | – | – | – |
| `public String getSku()` | Retrieve the SKU of the product. | – | `String` SKU | None |
| `public void setSku(String sku)` | Set the SKU. | `String sku` | – | Mutates `sku` field |

*Reusable / Utility*:  
- The getter/setter are straightforward and can be reused across the domain for any `Entity` that needs a SKU field.

## 4. Dependencies  
| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `java.io.Serializable` | Standard JDK | Enables serialization. |
| `com.salesmanager.shop.model.entity.Entity` | Third‑party / internal | Base class providing common entity attributes (not shown). |
| None else | – | The class is framework‑agnostic; no Spring, JPA, or JSON libraries are explicitly used. |

## 5. Additional Notes  
### Edge Cases & Potential Issues  
- **Null SKU**: No null‑check or validation; a null SKU could propagate to the database or API.  
- **Equality / Hashing**: The class does not override `equals()` or `hashCode()`. If instances are stored in collections or compared, the default `Object` behavior may be insufficient.  
- **Serialization Versioning**: The `serialVersionUID` is hard‑coded as `1L`. If future versions of the class change structure, this may lead to `InvalidClassException` unless the UID is updated accordingly.  

### Suggested Enhancements  
1. **Add More Fields**  
   - `quantity`, `price`, `discount`, `productId` etc. would make the model more expressive.  
2. **Validation**  
   - Use annotations (`@NotNull`, `@Size`) or explicit checks in `setSku()` to enforce business rules.  
3. **Immutability**  
   - Consider making the class immutable (`final` fields, no setters) to improve thread safety and clarity.  
4. **Equals & HashCode**  
   - Implement these based on `sku` or a composite key if necessary.  
5. **Builder Pattern**  
   - For richer objects, a builder could simplify construction while keeping the class immutable.  

### Future Extensions  
- Integration with JPA/Hibernate (`@Entity`, `@Column`) if persistence is required.  
- JSON serialization annotations (`@JsonProperty`) for REST APIs.  
- Domain‑specific validation or conversion methods (e.g., to a view model or DTO for the frontend).  

Overall, the current implementation is a minimal, clean DTO suitable for simple scenarios but would benefit from additional robustness and feature support as the application evolves.

public class OrderProduct extends Entity implements Serializable {

	/**

	 */
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	private String sku;
	public String getSku() {
		return sku;
	}
