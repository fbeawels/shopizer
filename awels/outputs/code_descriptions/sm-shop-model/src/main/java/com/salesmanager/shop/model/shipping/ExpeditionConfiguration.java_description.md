# ExpeditionConfiguration.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  

The **`ExpeditionConfiguration`** class is a plain‑old Java object (POJO) that encapsulates configuration flags for a shipping system. It holds three pieces of state:

| Field | Purpose | Type |
|-------|---------|------|
| `iternationalShipping` | Indicates whether international shipping is enabled. | `boolean` |
| `taxOnShipping` | Indicates whether a tax should be applied to shipping costs. | `boolean` |
| `shipToCountry` | Holds a list of country codes (ISO 3166‑1 alpha‑2) to which shipping is permitted. | `List<String>` |

The class exposes the standard getter/setter API for each field, enabling JavaBeans style access and manipulation. No additional logic or validation is present.

**Design style**  
- No design patterns are applied; this is simply a data container.  
- The class relies only on Java SE (`java.util.List`, `java.util.ArrayList`) and thus has zero third‑party dependencies.  
- It follows conventional naming conventions except for a minor typo (`iternationalShipping` vs. “international”).

---

## 2. Detailed Description  

### Core Components  

1. **Fields** – Private members store the configuration state.  
2. **Constructors** – The class only has the default no‑arg constructor implicitly provided by the compiler.  
3. **Getters / Setters** – Public methods allow reading and mutating the configuration.

### Execution Flow  

- **Initialization**: When an instance is created, `iternationalShipping` and `taxOnShipping` default to `false`, and `shipToCountry` is instantiated as an empty `ArrayList`.  
- **Runtime Behavior**: The application can read or modify each flag or the list of shipping countries via the getters/setters.  
- **Cleanup**: No special cleanup logic is required; the class contains no external resources.

### Assumptions & Constraints  

- The field name `iternationalShipping` is likely a typo; it should probably be `internationalShipping`.  
- The class does not enforce immutability or validation. Users can add arbitrary country codes, duplicate entries, or null values.  
- There is no thread‑safety guarantee; if instances are shared between threads, external synchronization is required.  
- The list returned by `getShipToCountry()` is the *live* internal list, so callers can mutate the state directly. This may be intentional but is a common source of bugs.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Signature | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Side‑Effects |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
| `isIternationalShipping()` | `public boolean isIternationalShipping()` | Returns the current value of `iternationalShipping`. | – | `boolean` | None |
| `setIternationalShipping(boolean)` | `public void setIternationalShipping(boolean iternationalShipping)` | Sets `iternationalShipping`. | `boolean` | – | Updates internal flag |
| `getShipToCountry()` | `public List<String> getShipToCountry()` | Provides access to the list of shipping countries. | – | `List<String>` | Returns reference to internal list |
| `setShipToCountry(List<String>)` | `public void setShipToCountry(List<String> shipToCountry)` | Replaces the internal list with a new one. | `List<String>` | – | Replaces reference |
| `isTaxOnShipping()` | `public boolean isTaxOnShipping()` | Returns current value of `taxOnShipping`. | – | `boolean` | None |
| `setTaxOnShipping(boolean)` | `public void setTaxOnShipping(boolean taxOnShipping)` | Sets `taxOnShipping`. | `boolean` | – | Updates internal flag |

**Utility / Reusable**  
- None. The class is purely a data holder.

## 4. Dependencies  

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `java.util.List` | Standard Java SE | Interface for the shipping country list. |
| `java.util.ArrayList` | Standard Java SE | Concrete implementation used for the default list. |

No third‑party libraries or external APIs are referenced. The code is platform‑agnostic and can run in any Java SE environment.

## 5. Additional Notes & Recommendations  

### 1. Naming Correction  
- The field and its accessor names contain a typo (`iternationalShipping`). This can be confusing for developers and may lead to integration issues if external code uses the correct spelling.  
  - **Fix**: Rename to `internationalShipping`, `isInternationalShipping()`, and `setInternationalShipping(boolean)`.

### 2. Immutability & Encapsulation  
- `getShipToCountry()` exposes the internal list, allowing callers to modify it directly.  
  - **Option 1**: Return an unmodifiable copy (`Collections.unmodifiableList(...)`).  
  - **Option 2**: Keep the list mutable but document the contract clearly.  
  - **Option 3**: Provide helper methods like `addShipToCountry(String)` and `removeShipToCountry(String)` to control mutation.

### 3. Validation & Business Rules  
- The class currently accepts any `List<String>`, including `null` values or duplicate country codes.  
  - **Consider**: Adding validation in setters (e.g., check for `null`, enforce ISO codes) to prevent inconsistent state.

### 4. Thread‑Safety  
- If instances may be shared across threads, consider making the class immutable or synchronizing access to mutable state.

### 5. Documentation  
- Javadoc comments for each method and the class would improve maintainability and aid IDE auto‑generation.

### 6. Future Enhancements  
- **Builder Pattern**: To simplify object creation when many optional flags are involved.  
- **Enum for Country**: Replace `String` with an enum or dedicated `Country` type to reduce errors.  
- **Serialization Support**: Add `implements Serializable` if the configuration needs to be persisted or transmitted.  

By addressing these items, the class will be more robust, easier to maintain, and less error‑prone.

	private List<String> shipToCountry = new ArrayList<String>();

	public boolean isIternationalShipping() {
		return iternationalShipping;
	}

		this.iternationalShipping = iternationalShipping;
	}

	public List<String> getShipToCountry() {
		return shipToCountry;
	}

	public void setShipToCountry(List<String> shipToCountry) {
		this.shipToCountry = shipToCountry;
	}

	public boolean isTaxOnShipping() {
		return taxOnShipping;
