# RelatedProduct.java

## Review

## 1. Summary
`RelatedProduct` is a minimal Java POJO that extends a base `Product` class and adds a single property, `relationShipType`. It implements `Serializable`, providing a serial UID, and offers a standard getter/setter pair for the new field. The class appears to be part of a larger catalog/model layer within the `com.salesmanager.shop.model.catalog.product` package.

- **Key components**  
  - `relationShipType`: a string indicating the type of relationship (e.g., `RELATED_ITEM`, `BUNDLED_ITEM`).  
  - Getter & setter for the relationship type.  
  - Implements `Serializable` to support object‑serialization (e.g., caching, transmission).  

- **Design patterns / libraries**  
  - No explicit patterns; it is a simple DTO.  
  - Uses standard Java serialization (no external libraries).

## 2. Detailed Description
`RelatedProduct` inherits all fields and behaviour from `Product`. It augments the base class with an additional attribute that describes how the product is related to another. The class is intended to be used wherever a product reference with relationship semantics is required—perhaps in recommendation engines, bundle creation, or catalog display.

Execution flow:
1. **Initialization** – An instance of `RelatedProduct` is created via the default constructor (inherited from `Product`).  
2. **Runtime behavior** – The relationship type can be set or retrieved at any time; otherwise, the object behaves exactly like a `Product`.  
3. **Serialization** – The presence of `serialVersionUID` allows safe serialization/deserialization, assuming that the parent `Product` class is also serializable.  
4. **Cleanup** – None required; the class has no resources to release.

Assumptions/constraints:
- The parent `Product` class must be serializable; otherwise, attempting to serialize a `RelatedProduct` will fail at runtime.  
- The `relationShipType` field is treated as a plain string; no validation or enumeration is enforced.

Design choices:
- Straightforward extension of `Product` rather than composition, implying that a `RelatedProduct` *is-a* `Product`.  
- Keeping the field private with a public accessor pair follows JavaBean conventions, facilitating frameworks that rely on reflection (e.g., Hibernate, Jackson).

## 3. Functions/Methods
| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Return | Side Effects |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|--------------|
| `public void setRelationShipType(String relationShipType)` | Stores the relationship type. | `relationShipType`: string describing the relation. | `void` | Sets the private field `relationShipType`. |
| `public String getRelationShipType()` | Retrieves the stored relationship type. | None | `String` | None. |

The class contains no reusable or utility methods beyond these accessors. The `serialVersionUID` field is a standard static final long used by the Java serialization mechanism.

## 4. Dependencies
| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `java.io.Serializable` | Standard Java API | Required for serialization. |
| `com.salesmanager.shop.model.catalog.product.Product` | Internal | Parent class; not shown here but must be in the same package or imported. |

No third‑party libraries or framework-specific annotations are used. The implementation is platform‑agnostic within any Java SE/EE environment that supports serialization.

## 5. Additional Notes
### Edge Cases & Potential Issues
1. **Non‑Serializable Parent** – If `Product` does **not** implement `Serializable`, attempting to serialize a `RelatedProduct` instance will throw a `NotSerializableException`. This should be verified during integration.  
2. **Naming Inconsistency** – The field is named `relationShipType` (capital “S”) while the conventional camelCase would be `relationshipType`. Consistency matters for readability and tooling that relies on naming conventions.  
3. **Validation** – No checks are performed on the supplied relationship type. If the system expects only a limited set of values, consider enforcing this via an enum or validating input in the setter.  
4. **Equality / Hashing** – Since the class extends `Product`, if `Product` overrides `equals`/`hashCode`, adding a new field may break contract assumptions. Review those methods if present.

### Suggested Enhancements
- **Enum for Relationship Types** – Replace `String` with a typed enum (`RelationshipType`) to prevent invalid values and improve type safety.  
- **Override `toString` / `equals` / `hashCode`** – Ensure these reflect the new field or delegate appropriately to `Product`.  
- **Lombok Annotations** – If Lombok is available, `@Data` or `@Getter @Setter` could reduce boilerplate.  
- **Constructor Overloading** – Provide a constructor that accepts a `Product` instance and a relationship type for easier instantiation.  
- **Documentation** – Add Javadoc comments explaining the semantic meaning of each relationship type and how it is used within the application.

Overall, the class is intentionally lightweight and serves as a simple extension point. The main considerations revolve around ensuring parent compatibility, naming consistency, and potential type safety improvements.

```java
package com.salesmanager.shop.model.catalog.product;

import java.io.Serializable;

public class RelatedProduct extends Product implements Serializable {

	/**
	 * 
	 */
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	private String relationShipType; //RELATED_ITEM ~ BUNDLED_ITEM
	public void setRelationShipType(String relationShipType) {
		this.relationShipType = relationShipType;
	}
	public String getRelationShipType() {
		return relationShipType;
	}

}
