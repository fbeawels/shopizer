# SecuredCustomer.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
`SecuredCustomer` is a DTO (Data Transfer Object) that augments the base `PersistableCustomer` with two new fields: `password` and `checkPassword`. It adds bean‑validation constraints and a custom `@FieldMatch` annotation to ensure the two password fields are identical. The class implements `Serializable`, making it suitable for use in HTTP sessions, messaging, or any other context that requires object serialization.

**Key components**

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `PersistableCustomer` | Provides core customer attributes (id, name, email, etc.). |
| `@FieldMatch.List` | Custom validation that checks two fields for equality. |
| `@Size` | Enforces a minimum length of 6 characters on both password fields. |
| `Serializable` | Enables the object to be serialized for session storage or remote transmission. |

The code relies on standard Java (`Serializable`) and Java Bean Validation (JSR‑380) annotations, plus a project‑specific `FieldMatch` validator.

## 2. Detailed Description  

### Core Flow
1. **Instantiation** – A client (e.g., a controller) creates a `SecuredCustomer` instance and populates it with user‑supplied data.
2. **Validation** – When the object is validated (e.g., via `@Valid` in a Spring controller), the following checks occur:
   * `@Size(min=6)` ensures each password string is at least six characters long.
   * The custom `@FieldMatch` validator verifies that `password` and `checkPassword` contain the same value.
3. **Persistence / Business Logic** – After validation, the DTO can be converted to an entity, where the plain‑text password should be hashed before persistence.  
4. **Cleanup** – No explicit cleanup is required; the class contains no resources that need to be closed.

### Design Choices
* **Separation of Concerns** – The DTO only contains validation metadata; it does not handle persistence logic or password hashing.
* **Reusability** – By extending `PersistableCustomer`, the class inherits common customer fields, avoiding duplication.
* **Extensibility** – Adding more validation constraints (e.g., `@Pattern` for password complexity) is straightforward.

### Assumptions & Constraints
* The surrounding framework (likely Spring MVC) performs bean validation automatically.
* The `FieldMatch` validator is correctly implemented and registered with the validation provider.
* The `PersistableCustomer` class is serializable and defines all necessary fields.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Return | Side‑Effects |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|--------------|
| `getPassword()` | Retrieve the plain‑text password. | None | `String` | None |
| `setPassword(String password)` | Set the plain‑text password. | `String password` | `void` | Stores value in field |
| `getCheckPassword()` | Retrieve the password confirmation. | None | `String` | None |
| `setCheckPassword(String checkPassword)` | Set the password confirmation. | `String checkPassword` | `void` | Stores value in field |

**Utility notes**  
* The class relies entirely on standard getter/setter patterns; no additional business logic is present.

## 4. Dependencies  

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `java.io.Serializable` | Standard Java | Enables session/serialization support. |
| `javax.validation.constraints.Size` | Bean Validation (JSR‑380) | Requires a validation provider (e.g., Hibernate Validator). |
| `com.salesmanager.shop.validation.FieldMatch` | Project‑specific | Custom constraint that must be implemented elsewhere in the codebase. |
| `PersistableCustomer` | Internal | Base customer DTO/entity. |

No external frameworks (Spring, Hibernate) are referenced directly in this file, but the annotations imply the presence of a validation framework.

## 5. Additional Notes & Recommendations  

### Security Concerns
1. **Plain‑text Password Exposure**  
   * The DTO stores passwords in plain text. Ensure that the conversion to the entity layer includes hashing (e.g., BCrypt) before persistence.  
   * Consider marking `checkPassword` as `transient` or removing it from the serialized form to avoid accidental exposure in logs or session snapshots.

2. **Missing `@NotNull` / `@NotBlank`**  
   * `@Size(min=6)` allows `null` values; a user could bypass the length check by omitting the password.  
   * Add `@NotBlank` (or `@NotNull` + `@Size`) to guarantee that a password is supplied.

3. **Password Complexity**  
   * A minimum length of 6 is weak by modern security standards. Enforce stronger policies with `@Pattern` or a dedicated validator (e.g., require a mix of character types).

### Validation Flow
* The `FieldMatch` validator should handle `null` values gracefully. If one field is null and the other non‑null, the validation should fail.

### Code Clean‑Up
* If the project uses Lombok, you could replace boilerplate getters/setters with `@Data`.  
* Override `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()` if instances of this DTO are compared or logged.

### Future Enhancements
1. **Immutable DTO** – Make the DTO immutable by passing values via a constructor, improving thread safety.  
2. **Password Strength API** – Expose an API endpoint that validates password strength asynchronously.  
3. **Audit Trail** – Log password change events for compliance.

### Edge Cases
* If a user enters a password that satisfies the minimum length but fails the `FieldMatch` test, the validation message should be clear (`"password.notequal"`).  
* The class currently does not prevent a malicious user from setting a password that is too short via a direct POST request; validation must be enforced server‑side and not rely solely on client‑side checks.

---

**Overall assessment:**  
The `SecuredCustomer` class is concise and correctly leverages bean‑validation annotations to enforce password constraints. However, it should be hardened with stronger password policies, null checks, and careful handling of plain‑text passwords during serialization. Adding the discussed improvements will make the DTO more robust and secure for production use.

```java
package com.salesmanager.shop.model.customer;

import java.io.Serializable;
import javax.validation.constraints.Size;
import com.salesmanager.shop.validation.FieldMatch;


@FieldMatch.List({
    @FieldMatch(first="password",second="checkPassword",message="password.notequal")
    
})
public class SecuredCustomer extends PersistableCustomer implements Serializable {

	/**
	 *
	 */
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	


	@Size(min=6, message="{registration.password.not.empty}")
	private String password;
	
	@Size(min=6, message="{registration.password.not.empty}")
	private String checkPassword;
	


	public String getPassword() {
		return password;
	}

	public void setPassword(String password) {
		this.password = password;
	}

    public String getCheckPassword()
    {
        return checkPassword;
    }

    public void setCheckPassword( String checkPassword )
    {
        this.checkPassword = checkPassword;
    }
	
	

}
