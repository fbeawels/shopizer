# OrderFacade.java

## Review

## 1. Summary
The `OrderFacade` interface defines a single contract for generating an `ReadableOrderConfirmation` from a set of domain objects (`Order`, `Customer`, `MerchantStore`, and `Language`). It acts as a façade that abstracts the complex logic of building an order confirmation (e.g., formatting, localization, and business rules) from the rest of the application. The design follows the **Facade** pattern, providing a simple API for higher‑level layers (controllers, services, etc.) to obtain a ready‑to‑display confirmation DTO.

Key points:
- **Single responsibility**: Only one method – `orderConfirmation` – is exposed, keeping the contract minimal.
- **DTO usage**: Returns a `ReadableOrderConfirmation`, a lightweight, serialisable object meant for the presentation layer.
- **Dependency injection friendly**: As an interface, it can be implemented by different concrete classes, making it easily mockable for tests.

The code relies on the domain model (`Order`, `Customer`, `MerchantStore`, `Language`) and a DTO (`ReadableOrderConfirmation`), but does not directly depend on any framework (e.g., Spring) or external libraries.

## 2. Detailed Description
### Core Components
| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `OrderFacade` | Interface exposing the contract for generating order confirmations. |
| `Order` | Domain entity representing the purchased order. |
| `Customer` | Domain entity representing the buyer. |
| `MerchantStore` | Domain entity representing the store context (currency, locale, etc.). |
| `Language` | Domain entity holding locale/language information. |
| `ReadableOrderConfirmation` | DTO that contains the data to be shown in the confirmation page or sent via email. |

### Flow of Execution
1. **Invocation**: A controller or service layer receives an `Order` and its related context objects.  
2. **Facade Call**: It calls `orderConfirmation(order, customer, store, language)`.  
3. **Processing**: The concrete implementation:
   - Extracts necessary fields from `Order` (total, items, shipping, etc.).
   - Localises strings using `Language`.
   - Applies merchant‑specific formatting rules (currency, taxes, discounts).
   - Builds and returns a `ReadableOrderConfirmation`.  
4. **Presentation**: The returned DTO is passed to the view layer or serialised for API responses.

### Assumptions & Constraints
- All four arguments (`Order`, `Customer`, `MerchantStore`, `Language`) are non‑null. The interface does not document null‑handling; concrete implementations must decide whether to validate or propagate `NullPointerException`.
- The domain model objects contain all necessary data for confirmation (e.g., `Order` must hold shipping details, payment status, etc.).
- Localization logic is expected to be handled by the implementation, not the interface.
- No thread‑safety guarantees are specified; implementations may be stateless.

### Architecture & Design Choices
- **Facade Pattern**: Simplifies complex domain logic into a single method, encouraging separation of concerns.
- **DTO Return Type**: Keeps presentation concerns decoupled from domain entities, which is especially useful in a layered architecture.
- **Interface‑Based**: Facilitates unit testing and allows multiple implementations (e.g., a mock for integration tests, a real implementation that calls external services).

## 3. Functions/Methods
| Method | Signature | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Side Effects |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
| `orderConfirmation` | `ReadableOrderConfirmation orderConfirmation(Order order, Customer customer, MerchantStore store, Language language)` | Builds a human‑readable order confirmation DTO based on the provided domain objects. | `Order` – order details. <br>`Customer` – buyer information. <br>`MerchantStore` – store context (currency, locale). <br>`Language` – localization settings. | `ReadableOrderConfirmation` – DTO ready for display or serialization. | None (should be side‑effect free). |

> **Reusable / Utility**  
> None – the interface only declares a single business‑logic method. Reusability lies in the implementation; the interface itself is a contract.

## 4. Dependencies
| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.customer.Customer` | Domain (internal) | Represents the customer entity. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.merchant.MerchantStore` | Domain (internal) | Holds store‑specific settings. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.order.Order` | Domain (internal) | Contains order data. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.reference.language.Language` | Domain (internal) | Holds language/locale information. |
| `com.salesmanager.shop.model.order.v1.ReadableOrderConfirmation` | DTO (internal) | Light‑weight, serialisable confirmation object. |

All dependencies are **internal to the SalesManager project**; no external third‑party libraries or platform‑specific APIs are required for this interface.

## 5. Additional Notes
### Edge Cases & Potential Issues
1. **Null Parameters** – The method signature does not specify behaviour for null arguments.  
   *Recommendation*: Document expected behaviour (e.g., throw `IllegalArgumentException`) or annotate with `@NonNull` if using a static‑analysis tool.

2. **Locale Mismatch** – If `Language` and `MerchantStore` locale settings differ, the implementation must decide which to prioritize.  
   *Recommendation*: Clarify precedence in documentation.

3. **Immutable DTO** – `ReadableOrderConfirmation` should be immutable to avoid accidental mutation after creation. Ensure that the concrete implementation returns a defensive copy or an immutable object.

4. **Performance** – Building the confirmation might involve expensive operations (e.g., formatting large item lists). Consider lazy evaluation or streaming if necessary.

### Future Enhancements
- **Pagination/Chunking** – For orders with many items, allow the DTO to be split into pages or include a `nextPageToken`.
- **Customizable Format** – Expose an enum or strategy to switch between email, PDF, or web‑view formats.
- **Extension Points** – Add callback or listener hooks for custom extensions (e.g., adding promotional messages).
- **Localization Cache** – If language resources are expensive to load, cache them within the implementation.

### Documentation & Testing
- **Javadoc**: Add method-level documentation explaining parameters, return value, and exception contracts.
- **Unit Tests**: Create mocks for `Order`, `Customer`, etc., and verify that the returned `ReadableOrderConfirmation` contains expected values.
- **Mock Implementation**: Provide a lightweight stub for integration tests that simply copies data over.

By addressing the above considerations, the `OrderFacade` can evolve into a robust, well‑documented component that cleanly bridges the domain layer with presentation or API layers.
