# CustomShippingQuoteItem.java

## Review

## 1. Summary
The file defines an **abstract Java class** `CustomShippingQuoteItem` that represents a generic item used in shipping quote calculations.  
Key features:

- **Fields**:  
  - `priceText` – a human‑readable representation of the price (e.g., "$10.00").  
  - `price` – a `BigDecimal` holding the numeric value of the price.  
- **Accessors**: Standard getter/setter pairs for both fields.  
- **Design**: The class is declared `abstract`, indicating that concrete subclasses will provide additional behavior or state specific to a particular shipping integration.

No external libraries or frameworks are referenced directly; the class relies only on `java.math.BigDecimal` and standard Java types.

## 2. Detailed Description
The class serves as a **data transfer object (DTO)** or a **base model** for shipping quote items across different integration modules.  
Typical flow:

1. **Instantiation**: Subclasses instantiate `CustomShippingQuoteItem` and populate the fields via setters or a constructor (not shown here).  
2. **Usage**: Other parts of the shipping integration layer (e.g., service, controller, or UI) read the values through getters to display or process shipping quotes.  
3. **Extension**: Because the class is abstract, each concrete shipping provider (e.g., FedEx, UPS) can add provider‑specific attributes (tracking numbers, service levels, etc.) while still sharing the common price logic.

Assumptions & constraints:

- **Immutability** is not enforced; callers can modify the fields after construction.  
- **Locale/Formatting**: `priceText` is expected to be pre‑formatted; the class does not provide any formatting logic, assuming that formatting happens elsewhere.  
- **Null safety**: No checks are performed on `priceText` or `price`, so callers must guard against nulls if needed.

## 3. Functions/Methods
| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Return | Side‑Effects |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|--------------|
| `setPriceText(String priceText)` | Stores the human‑readable price string. | `priceText` – the formatted price. | `void` | Mutates `this.priceText`. |
| `getPriceText()` | Retrieves the formatted price string. | None | `String` – current `priceText`. | None |
| `setPrice(BigDecimal price)` | Stores the numeric price value. | `price` – numeric price. | `void` | Mutates `this.price`. |
| `getPrice()` | Retrieves the numeric price. | None | `BigDecimal` – current `price`. | None |

**Reusable/Utility methods**: None beyond the standard getters/setters. The class is intentionally minimal to act as a simple data holder.

## 4. Dependencies
| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `java.math.BigDecimal` | JDK Standard | Provides arbitrary‑precision decimal arithmetic. |
| None other | | The class is framework‑agnostic; it can be used in Spring, Jakarta EE, or any Java environment. |

No external libraries are required, making the class lightweight and portable.

## 5. Additional Notes
### Edge Cases & Limitations
- **Null Handling**: If callers pass `null` to setters, the fields will be `null`. Subsequent code that relies on non‑null values (e.g., arithmetic operations) may throw `NullPointerException`. Consider adding defensive checks or documenting that `null` is disallowed.
- **Immutability**: In many DTO scenarios, making the object immutable (final fields, no setters, constructor‑only initialization) increases thread safety and predictability. If the design permits, refactor to an immutable variant.
- **Formatting Responsibility**: The class trusts that `priceText` is already formatted correctly. If formatting logic is scattered across the codebase, it might lead to inconsistencies. A dedicated formatter or helper could centralize formatting logic.

### Future Enhancements
1. **Constructor Overloads**: Provide constructors that accept `price` and automatically derive `priceText` via a formatting strategy, reducing boilerplate for subclasses.
2. **Validation**: Add basic validation (e.g., non‑negative price) to enforce business rules early.
3. **Serialization Support**: If instances are exposed via APIs, consider annotating with JSON annotations (`@JsonProperty`) or implementing `Serializable`.
4. **Utility Methods**: A `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()` implementation would aid debugging and collection handling.
5. **Localization**: Allow specifying locale or currency in the class to produce locale‑aware `priceText`.

Overall, the class is clean and straightforward, serving its purpose as a minimal base model for shipping quote items. Adding a few defensive features and documentation would improve robustness without compromising its lightweight nature.

```java
package com.salesmanager.core.modules.integration.shipping.model;

import java.math.BigDecimal;

public abstract class CustomShippingQuoteItem {
	
	private String priceText;
	private BigDecimal price;
	public void setPriceText(String priceText) {
		this.priceText = priceText;
	}
	public String getPriceText() {
		return priceText;
	}
	public void setPrice(BigDecimal price) {
		this.price = price;
	}
	public BigDecimal getPrice() {
		return price;
	}

}
