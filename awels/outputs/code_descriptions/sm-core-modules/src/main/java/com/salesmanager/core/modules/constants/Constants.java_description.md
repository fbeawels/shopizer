# Constants.java

## Review

## 1. Summary
- **Purpose**: This file defines a single compile‑time constant (`DISTANCE_KEY`) that is intended to be used as a key (likely in a `Map`, `Bundle`, or similar data‑structure) across the `com.salesmanager.core.modules` package.  
- **Key component**: The `Constants` class acts as a centralized location for shared constant values, following the “constants‑holder” pattern commonly used in Java projects.  
- **Design pattern**: It uses the *Constant Interface* pattern (via a dedicated class rather than an interface) – a lightweight approach for sharing immutable values.

## 2. Detailed Description
- **Structure**:  
  - The class is declared in the package `com.salesmanager.core.modules.constants`.  
  - It contains a single `public static final` field named `DISTANCE_KEY`.  
- **Execution Flow**:  
  - No runtime logic exists; the field is initialized at class‑loading time.  
  - Other classes reference it via `Constants.DISTANCE_KEY`.  
- **Assumptions & Constraints**:  
  - The constant is a `String`; callers must treat it as an immutable key.  
  - The class assumes that the key will not change during runtime.  
- **Architecture**:  
  - The project likely groups all shared literals in a similar manner to avoid hard‑coding strings throughout the codebase.  

## 3. Functions/Methods
| Method | Description | Inputs | Output | Side‑effects |
|--------|-------------|--------|--------|--------------|
| **None** | The class contains no methods; it only exposes a public static field. | N/A | N/A | N/A |

*Reusable/Utility methods*: None, as the class serves solely as a container for constants.

## 4. Dependencies
| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| Java Standard Library | Standard | No external libraries are used. |

## 5. Additional Notes
- **Immutability**: The field is `public static final`, which is the idiomatic way to expose constants in Java.  
- **Class Design**:  
  - Making the class `final` and adding a private constructor (`private Constants() {}`) would prevent accidental subclassing or instantiation, aligning with best practices for utility/constant classes.  
  - Adding Javadoc comments would clarify the intended usage of `DISTANCE_KEY`.  
- **Extensibility**:  
  - If more constants are added in the future, consider grouping related constants into nested static classes or enums for better organization (e.g., `public static final class Distance { public static final String KEY = "DISTANCE_KEY"; }`).  
  - If the constant is meant to be used in external contexts (e.g., JSON keys, intent extras), documenting its scope and format can reduce confusion.  
- **Edge Cases**: The code itself has no runtime edge cases, but care should be taken that the key remains unique within the context it's used (e.g., avoid collisions with other keys).  

**Recommendation**: While the current implementation is functional, a small refactor to make the class `final`, add a private constructor, and include Javadoc would improve maintainability and signal intent to future developers.
