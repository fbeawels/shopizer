# CustomShippingQuoteWeightItem.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
`CustomShippingQuoteWeightItem` is a lightweight POJO that represents a shipping‑quote line item constrained by a maximum weight.  It extends the base class `CustomShippingQuoteItem`, inherits a monetary `price`, and adds:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `maximumWeight` | `int` | The highest weight (in whatever unit the system uses) that this quote applies to. |
| `priceText` | `String` | A human‑readable textual representation of the price (e.g., “$9.99”). |

The class implements `org.json.simple.JSONAware` so that instances can be serialised to JSON via `toJSONString()`.  The JSON representation currently contains only `price` and `maximumWeight`.

The code uses the `org.json.simple` library (a lightweight third‑party JSON library) and relies on the parent class for `price` handling.

---

## 2. Detailed Description  

### Core Flow  
1. **Construction** – The class relies on the default constructor (not explicitly declared) and the setters to initialise its state.  
2. **State Mutation** – `setMaximumWeight(int)` and `setPriceText(String)` update the internal fields.  
3. **JSON Serialisation** – `toJSONString()` builds a `JSONObject`, inserts `price` from the parent and `maximumWeight` from this instance, and returns the JSON string.  

The class does **not** provide any lifecycle or cleanup logic; it is purely a data container.

### Interaction with Superclass  
- `super.getPrice()` is called in `toJSONString()`.  No other parent methods are used, implying that `CustomShippingQuoteItem` probably provides getters/setters for the price and maybe a `toString` or other behaviour that is not overridden here.

### Design Choices  
- **Immutability** – The class is *mutable*; callers can change fields after construction.  
- **Validation** – No input validation is performed.  Negative weights or null price texts will be silently accepted.  
- **JSON Structure** – The JSON output is deliberately minimal.  `priceText` is omitted, which may be an oversight if the consumer expects a textual price.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Signature | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Side Effects |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
| `public String getPriceText()` | `() -> String` | Retrieve the textual price. | None | `priceText` | None |
| `public void setPriceText(String)` | `(String)` | Assign a new textual price. | `priceText` | None | Modifies internal state |
| `public void setMaximumWeight(int)` | `(int)` | Assign a new maximum weight. | `maximumWeight` | None | Modifies internal state |
| `public int getMaximumWeight()` | `() -> int` | Retrieve the maximum weight. | None | `maximumWeight` | None |
| `public String toJSONString()` | `() -> String` | Serialise the object to a JSON string. | None | JSON string containing `price` and `maximumWeight` | None (creates temporary `JSONObject`) |

### Utility / Re‑use Potential  
- `toJSONString()` can be reused by any consumer that requires a JSON representation of the quote.  
- Getters/setters are standard and could be replaced by Lombok annotations to reduce boilerplate in future iterations.

## 4. Dependencies  

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `org.json.simple` | Third‑party | Lightweight JSON library used for serialisation. No heavy dependencies. |
| `CustomShippingQuoteItem` | Internal | Base class providing the `price` field and potentially other quote‑related behaviour. |
| `JSONAware` | Interface from `org.json.simple` | Signals that the class can produce JSON. |

All dependencies are straightforward; no platform‑specific assumptions are evident.

## 5. Additional Notes  

### Strengths  
- **Simplicity** – The class is small, clear, and focused on its domain.  
- **Decoupled JSON** – By implementing `JSONAware`, the object can be serialised without external adapters.

### Weaknesses / Edge Cases  
1. **Missing Validation** – Negative weights, zero weights, or null `priceText` are allowed.  Depending on business rules, this may lead to incorrect shipping quotes.  
2. **Immutability vs. Mutability** – In a concurrent environment, mutable state could cause race conditions.  Consider making the object immutable (final fields, constructor injection).  
3. **`priceText` Exclusion** – The JSON output intentionally omits `priceText`.  If consumers rely on a human‑readable price, this is a bug.  
4. **`toJSONString` Unchecked Cast** – The `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` is required because `JSONObject.put` is raw‑typed.  This is benign but could be avoided by using a newer JSON library (e.g., Jackson or Gson).  
5. **Missing `equals` / `hashCode`** – Without these, instances cannot be reliably used in collections or compared.  
6. **No Javadoc** – The API would benefit from documentation explaining each field and method.

### Future Enhancements  
- **Validation Layer** – Add checks in setters or a dedicated `validate()` method.  
- **Immutability** – Provide a constructor that sets all fields and remove setters.  
- **Enhanced JSON** – Include `priceText` or use a DTO that explicitly maps all needed properties.  
- **DTO Pattern** – Separate the business object from its JSON representation to keep concerns isolated.  
- **Unit Tests** – Create tests for JSON serialisation, edge cases, and validation.  
- **Serialization Library Upgrade** – Migrate to Jackson or Gson for type safety and richer features.  

Overall, the class serves its intended purpose but would benefit from a few robustness improvements and clearer documentation.
