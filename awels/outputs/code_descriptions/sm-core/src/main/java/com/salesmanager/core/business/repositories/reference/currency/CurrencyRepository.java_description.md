# CurrencyRepository.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  

The file defines a Spring Data JPA repository for the `Currency` entity.  
* **Purpose** – to provide CRUD operations and a simple lookup by currency code.  
* **Key components**  
  * `CurrencyRepository` – an interface extending `JpaRepository<Currency, Long>`.  
  * `getByCode(String code)` – a derived query method that Spring Data JPA automatically implements to find a `Currency` by its ISO code.  
* **Design patterns / frameworks** – Repository pattern via Spring Data JPA; method name conventions for query derivation.

## 2. Detailed Description  

### Core architecture  
1. **Repository Layer**  
   * `CurrencyRepository` is part of the persistence layer in a typical layered architecture (controller → service → repository).  
   * By extending `JpaRepository`, the interface inherits all standard CRUD operations (`save`, `findById`, `delete`, etc.) and paging/sorting capabilities.

2. **Derived Query Method**  
   * `getByCode(String code)` follows Spring Data’s method‑name parsing rules.  
   * At runtime, Spring generates a JPQL query equivalent to:  
     ```sql
     SELECT c FROM Currency c WHERE c.code = :code
     ```
   * The method returns a single `Currency` object (or `null` if not found). No `Optional` wrapper is used.

3. **Execution Flow**  
   * During application startup, Spring scans for interfaces extending `JpaRepository`, creates proxy implementations, and registers them as beans.  
   * Service layers inject `CurrencyRepository` and invoke `getByCode` when currency look‑ups are required.  
   * No explicit cleanup is necessary; the repository is managed by the Spring container.

### Assumptions & Constraints  
* The `Currency` entity must have a `code` field (typically annotated with `@Column(nullable = false, unique = true)`).  
* The method assumes the `code` is unique; otherwise, multiple results may be returned, causing `IncorrectResultSizeDataAccessException`.  
* Database indexing on `code` is recommended for performance.  
* No null‑safety checks are performed; passing `null` will result in a query that may return `null` or throw an exception depending on the JPA provider.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Returns | Side Effects |
|--------|---------|------------|---------|--------------|
| `Currency getByCode(String code)` | Retrieves a single `Currency` entity whose `code` field matches the supplied value. | `String code` – ISO currency code (e.g., "USD") | `Currency` object or `null` if not found | None; pure read operation. |

*Inherited from `JpaRepository<Currency, Long>`*  
- `save(Currency entity)`  
- `findById(Long id)`  
- `findAll()`  
- `delete(Currency entity)`  
- `deleteById(Long id)`  
- ... (and many others for paging, sorting, and bulk operations).

## 4. Dependencies  

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository` | Spring Data JPA (third‑party) | Provides CRUD and pagination functionality. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.reference.currency.Currency` | Internal | JPA entity representing a currency. |
| Spring Framework (implicit) | Framework | Required for component scanning, transaction management, and proxy creation. |
| JPA provider (e.g., Hibernate) | Optional | Actual implementation of JPA; not specified here. |

All dependencies are standard Spring ecosystem components; no platform‑specific libraries are used.

## 5. Additional Notes  

### Edge Cases & Potential Issues  
1. **Uniqueness of `code`** – If multiple `Currency` rows share the same code, Spring Data will throw an exception. Enforce a unique constraint at the database level.  
2. **Null Input** – Passing `null` to `getByCode` will generate a query with `WHERE c.code IS NULL`. If no such row exists, `null` is returned; otherwise, an unexpected match may occur. Consider adding a null check or using `Optional<Currency>` to make the contract explicit.  
3. **Case Sensitivity** – The query is case‑sensitive by default. If currency codes may be entered in varying case, either store them in a consistent case or use `LOWER(c.code) = LOWER(:code)` (via `@Query`).  
4. **Performance** – Ensure the `code` column is indexed; otherwise, look‑ups may become slow for large tables.

### Future Enhancements  
* **Optional Return** – Change method signature to `Optional<Currency> findByCode(String code)` for better null‑handling.  
* **Caching** – Apply Spring Cache annotations (`@Cacheable`) if currency data is read frequently and changes rarely.  
* **Custom Query** – If additional filtering (e.g., active status) is needed, replace the derived method with `@Query`.  
* **Pagination Support** – Add methods like `Page<Currency> findAll(Pageable pageable)` for listing currencies.  
* **Unit Tests** – Provide repository integration tests using an in‑memory database (H2) to verify query correctness and unique constraints.

Overall, the repository is concise and leverages Spring Data JPA effectively. It serves as a solid foundation for currency data access within the application.
