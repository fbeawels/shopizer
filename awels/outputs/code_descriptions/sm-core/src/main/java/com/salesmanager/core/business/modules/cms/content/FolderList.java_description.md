# FolderList.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
The file defines a **single Java interface** named `FolderList` that belongs to the package  
`com.salesmanager.core.business.modules.cms.content`.  
Its sole responsibility is to expose a contract for listing folder names (as `String` objects) for a given merchant store and an optional path prefix.  
The interface is meant to be implemented by classes that interact with the underlying content‑management system (file system, database, remote storage, etc.) and may raise a custom `ServiceException` to signal business‑level failures.  
No design patterns are explicitly used here, but the interface itself follows the **Strategy/Provider** pattern by abstracting the folder‑listing logic behind a simple API. The code is lightweight and relies only on standard Java (`java.util.List`, `java.util.Optional`) plus a project‑specific exception class.

## 2. Detailed Description  
### Core Components  
| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `FolderList` interface | Declares a contract for retrieving folder names. |
| `listFolders` method | Accepts a store identifier and an optional path, returns a list of folder names. |
| `ServiceException` | Custom exception signaling service‑layer problems. |

### Execution Flow (as intended by the interface)  
1. **Client Call** – Some business/service layer component requests a folder list by invoking `listFolders(merchantStoreCode, path)`.  
2. **Implementation Lookup** – The actual implementation (e.g., `FileSystemFolderList`, `DatabaseFolderList`, etc.) is resolved via dependency injection or a factory.  
3. **Business Logic** – The implementation performs whatever storage access is required, respects the optional `path` if present, and builds a `List<String>` of folder names.  
4. **Return / Error** – On success, the list is returned. If an error occurs (e.g., store not found, I/O failure), the implementation throws `ServiceException`.  

No cleanup logic is required here; any resources would be handled internally by the concrete implementation.

### Assumptions & Constraints  
- The `merchantStoreCode` uniquely identifies a store and is non‑null.  
- `path` is optional; when absent the implementation should return top‑level folders.  
- Implementations must handle both relative and absolute paths as per the application's conventions.  
- The returned list may be empty but should never be `null`.  
- The interface assumes the caller will catch or propagate `ServiceException`.  

### Architecture & Design Choices  
- **Separation of Concerns** – The interface decouples folder‑listing logic from higher‑level business processes.  
- **Optional Parameter** – Java 8’s `Optional` is used to model the optional path; however, using `Optional` as a parameter is debated (see below).  
- **Return Type** – A raw `List<String>` is chosen, keeping the API simple but potentially limiting if richer metadata is needed.

## 3. Functions/Methods  
| Method | Signature | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Side Effects |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
| `listFolders` | `List<String> listFolders(final String merchantStoreCode, Optional<String> path) throws ServiceException` | Retrieves a list of folder names for a given merchant store and an optional path. | * `merchantStoreCode` – unique identifier for a merchant store. <br> * `path` – optional path prefix; `Optional.empty()` indicates no path. | * `List<String>` – non‑null list of folder names; may be empty if no folders exist. | * May throw `ServiceException` if an error occurs during folder retrieval. |

**Reusable/Utility Methods** – None; the interface contains only the single contract method.

## 4. Dependencies  
| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `java.util.List` | Standard JDK | Collection of folder names. |
| `java.util.Optional` | Standard JDK | Represents an optional path argument. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.business.exception.ServiceException` | Project‑specific | Domain exception used throughout the SalesManager core. |
| **No external libraries or frameworks** – the interface is entirely JDK‑based. |

*Platform‑specific notes*: The code is pure Java and does not rely on any particular application server or container. However, concrete implementations may depend on file systems, database drivers, or cloud SDKs.

## 5. Additional Notes & Recommendations  

### 5.1 Optional as a Method Parameter  
Using `Optional<T>` for parameters is discouraged by many style guides (e.g., Oracle, Google). The intent of `Optional` is to signal a *missing return value*, not to replace `null` checks in method arguments.  
**Alternatives**  
- Accept a nullable `String` and document that `null` means “no path.”  
- Overload the method:  
  ```java
  List<String> listFolders(String merchantStoreCode) throws ServiceException;
  List<String> listFolders(String merchantStoreCode, String path) throws ServiceException;
  ```  

### 5.2 Naming Conventions  
- `FolderList` sounds like a *collection* rather than a service. A more conventional name would be `FolderProvider`, `FolderLister`, or `FolderService`.  
- Method name `listFolders` is fine, but consider `getFolderNames` if you want to emphasize retrieval of names rather than folder objects.

### 5.3 Return Type Precision  
Returning raw `String` names may be limiting if callers need additional metadata (e.g., creation date, size, permissions).  
**Possible Enhancements**  
- Introduce a `FolderInfo` DTO containing name plus metadata.  
- Keep the current method for legacy compatibility and add a new method that returns richer objects.

### 5.4 Error Handling  
`ServiceException` is a broad, unchecked exception. If implementations can throw more specific exceptions (e.g., `StoreNotFoundException`, `PathNotFoundException`), consider using a hierarchy or adding error codes.

### 5.5 Documentation & Javadoc  
Add comprehensive Javadoc to the interface and method, documenting:  
- The meaning of `merchantStoreCode`.  
- The semantics of the optional `path` (absolute vs relative, root handling).  
- Expected exceptions and their causes.  
- Example usage.

### 5.6 Thread‑Safety & Caching  
If implementations cache folder lists, document concurrency guarantees and cache invalidation policies.

### 5.7 Future Extensions  
- Pagination support for large folder hierarchies.  
- Filtering by folder type or attributes.  
- Support for wildcard or regex path patterns.

### Summary of Recommendations  

| Issue | Suggested Fix |
|-------|---------------|
| `Optional` as a parameter | Replace with nullable `String` or method overloads |
| Interface name | Rename to `FolderProvider`, `FolderLister`, etc. |
| Return type | Consider a DTO (`FolderInfo`) for richer data |
| Documentation | Add Javadoc explaining contract, parameters, and exceptions |
| Error granularity | Use more specific exception types if possible |
| Design consistency | Keep naming and contract aligned with other service interfaces |

Implementing these suggestions will improve code clarity, maintainability, and alignment with Java best practices.
