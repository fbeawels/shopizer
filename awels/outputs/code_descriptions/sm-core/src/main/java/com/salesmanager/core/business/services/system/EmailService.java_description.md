# EmailService.java

## Review

## 1. Summary

The `EmailService` interface defines a contract for sending HTML emails and managing email configuration per merchant store within the **SalesManager** core module.  
Key responsibilities:

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `sendHtmlEmail(MerchantStore, Email)` | Dispatches an HTML email to the intended recipients. |
| `getEmailConfiguration(MerchantStore)` | Retrieves the email configuration (SMTP host, port, credentials, etc.) for a particular store. |
| `saveEmailConfiguration(EmailConfig, MerchantStore)` | Persists a new or updated configuration for a store. |

The interface uses a **service layer** pattern, separating business logic from presentation and persistence concerns. It leverages custom exception handling (`ServiceException`) to surface domain‑specific error states to callers.

---

## 2. Detailed Description

### Execution Flow

1. **Initialization**  
   - A concrete implementation (e.g., `JavaMailEmailService`) would be injected (via Spring, CDI, etc.) into consumer beans.  
   - The implementation may lazily load configuration from a database or cache when `sendHtmlEmail` is called.

2. **Runtime Behavior**  
   - `sendHtmlEmail`  
     - Receives a `MerchantStore` context (for multi‑tenant support) and an `Email` object containing subject, body, recipients, etc.  
     - The implementation typically resolves the store’s `EmailConfig`, builds a MIME message, and sends it through an SMTP client.  
   - `getEmailConfiguration`  
     - Queries a persistence layer (DB, config service) to fetch the `EmailConfig` for the given store.  
   - `saveEmailConfiguration`  
     - Persists the supplied `EmailConfig` object, possibly performing validation and encryption of credentials.

3. **Cleanup**  
   - If the implementation holds onto resources (e.g., connection pools), these should be released in a `@PreDestroy` lifecycle callback or via a dedicated shutdown method.

### Assumptions & Constraints

| Assumption | Constraint |
|------------|------------|
| Each `MerchantStore` has a unique email configuration | Must store configuration per store in a reliable persistence layer |
| The `Email` object is fully validated before calling `sendHtmlEmail` | Implementation should guard against null values, malformed addresses, etc. |
| Network and SMTP server availability | The service should handle transient failures gracefully (retry logic, exponential backoff) |

### Architecture & Design Choices

- **Service Interface**: Provides a clear separation between contract and implementation, enabling multiple back‑ends (e.g., JavaMail, SendGrid, AWS SES).
- **Exception Strategy**: Uses a domain‑specific `ServiceException` for business‑level failures, but also declares a generic `Exception` for `sendHtmlEmail`. This may obscure the root cause and should be refined.
- **Dependency Injection**: The interface assumes a DI framework; no explicit constructors or configuration methods are needed.

## 3. Functions/Methods

| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Returns | Throws | Side‑Effects |
|--------|---------|------------|---------|--------|--------------|
| `void sendHtmlEmail(MerchantStore store, Email email)` | Sends an HTML email within the context of the provided store. | `store`: target merchant store.<br>`email`: email payload (subject, body, recipients). | `void` | `ServiceException`, `Exception` | Sends the email via SMTP; may log the operation. |
| `EmailConfig getEmailConfiguration(MerchantStore store)` | Retrieves the email configuration for the store. | `store`: target merchant store. | `EmailConfig` | `ServiceException` | None (read‑only). |
| `void saveEmailConfiguration(EmailConfig emailConfig, MerchantStore store)` | Persists the supplied email configuration for the store. | `emailConfig`: configuration to persist.<br>`store`: target merchant store. | `void` | `ServiceException` | Writes to persistence layer; may trigger cache invalidation. |

### Reusable/Utility Methods

The interface itself contains no utility methods. Implementations may expose helper methods (e.g., `buildMimeMessage`, `validateEmail`) but these would belong in concrete classes.

## 4. Dependencies

| Dependency | Category | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| `com.salesmanager.core.business.exception.ServiceException` | Custom Exception | Domain‑specific wrapper for service layer errors. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.business.modules.email.Email` | Model | Represents email content (subject, body, recipients). |
| `com.salesmanager.core.business.modules.email.EmailConfig` | Model | Stores SMTP configuration (host, port, credentials). |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.merchant.MerchantStore` | Model | Encapsulates store metadata (ID, locale, etc.). |

All dependencies are **internal to the SalesManager application**. No third‑party libraries are directly referenced in this interface; concrete implementations will bring in libraries such as JavaMail, Apache Commons Email, or cloud provider SDKs.

---

## 5. Additional Notes

### Strengths

- **Clear contract**: The interface cleanly separates concerns and supports multiple implementations.  
- **Multi‑tenant awareness**: Methods accept a `MerchantStore` to facilitate per‑store configuration.  
- **Custom exception**: `ServiceException` promotes consistent error handling across the service layer.

### Potential Issues & Edge Cases

1. **Generic `Exception` in `sendHtmlEmail`**  
   - Exposing `Exception` hides specific error types (e.g., `MessagingException`, `AuthenticationFailedException`).  
   - Recommendation: replace with a more granular exception hierarchy or document the specific conditions.

2. **Null or Empty Parameters**  
   - No null‑checks or validations in the interface signature.  
   - Implementations should guard against `null` values and provide meaningful messages.

3. **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Delivery**  
   - The interface forces synchronous sending.  
   - Future implementations might expose an asynchronous API or use callbacks.

4. **Attachment Support**  
   - The `Email` model’s capabilities are not shown.  
   - If attachments or inline resources are needed, the API may need to evolve.

5. **Security of Credentials**  
   - `EmailConfig` likely contains sensitive data.  
   - Ensure that persistence encrypts credentials and that in‑memory handling follows best practices.

### Future Enhancements

| Feature | Rationale | Suggested Implementation |
|---------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Asynchronous email dispatch** | Improve throughput and user experience. | Return `CompletableFuture<Void>` or expose `sendHtmlEmailAsync`. |
| **Retry & Backoff Strategy** | Handle transient SMTP failures. | Add `sendHtmlEmailWithRetry` or integrate with a retry library. |
| **Template Rendering** | Separate content from code. | Accept a template identifier and context map; use a templating engine (Thymeleaf, FreeMarker). |
| **Attachment API** | Support richer emails. | Extend `Email` model to include `List<EmailAttachment>`. |
| **Internationalization** | Support multiple locales. | Load email templates per store locale. |
| **Monitoring & Metrics** | Visibility into email delivery. | Expose metrics (sent, failed) via Micrometer. |

### Documentation & Testing

- **Javadoc**: Add comprehensive JavaDoc for each method, clarifying expected behavior, pre/post‑conditions, and exception semantics.
- **Unit Tests**: Provide tests for contract adherence using Mockito to mock dependencies.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify end‑to‑end email sending against a test SMTP server (e.g., MailHog).

---

### Conclusion

The `EmailService` interface is a solid foundation for a multi‑tenant email delivery subsystem. Its current design is straightforward but can benefit from tighter exception handling, richer API capabilities, and better documentation. Addressing the points above will enhance maintainability, robustness, and developer ergonomics.
