# DeleteProductVariantEvent.java

## Review

## 1. Summary

**Purpose & Functionality**  
The `DeleteProductVariantEvent` class represents an event fired when a `ProductVariant` is removed from a `Product`. It extends `ProductEvent` (most likely an `ApplicationEvent` in a Spring context), allowing listeners to react to variant deletions in a decoupled way.

**Key Components**  
- **`variant`** – the `ProductVariant` being deleted.  
- **Constructor** – accepts the event source, the variant, and the parent product, delegating the product to `ProductEvent`.  
- **`getVariant()`** – accessor for the variant.

**Notable Design Patterns / Libraries**  
- **Event‑Driven Architecture** – follows the observer pattern via Spring’s event mechanism.  
- **Inheritance** – extends a domain‑specific base event (`ProductEvent`).  
- **Serializable** – the event is marked `serialVersionUID = 1L`, indicating it implements `Serializable`.

## 2. Detailed Description

### Core Components & Interaction
| Component | Role | Interaction |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `DeleteProductVariantEvent` | Domain event class | Created when a variant is deleted; published to Spring’s `ApplicationEventPublisher`. |
| `ProductEvent` | Base event | Provides common fields (`source`, `product`) and potentially common behaviour. |
| `Product` / `ProductVariant` | Domain models | Represent the product hierarchy; the event holds references to these. |

### Flow of Execution
1. **Trigger** – Somewhere in the business logic, a variant deletion is processed.  
2. **Event Creation** – `new DeleteProductVariantEvent(this, variant, product)` is instantiated.  
3. **Publishing** – The event is published via Spring’s `ApplicationEventPublisher`.  
4. **Handling** – Registered listeners (`@EventListener` or `ApplicationListener`) receive the event, access the `variant` and `product` through getters, and perform side effects (e.g., cache invalidation, audit logging).  
5. **Cleanup** – The event instance is discarded after handling; no explicit cleanup is required.

### Assumptions & Constraints
- The `variant` and `product` arguments are non‑null; the code does not guard against nulls.  
- `ProductEvent` likely implements `Serializable` and may contain other useful metadata (e.g., timestamp).  
- The event is intended for intra‑application use (no external serialization required beyond Java’s default).  
- Listeners are expected to be lightweight to avoid blocking the event publisher.

### Architecture & Design Choices
- **Extending a Domain Event Base** – reduces duplication and keeps event types consistent.  
- **Serializable** – prepares the event for potential cross‑process or messaging scenarios.  
- **Minimalist API** – only the needed getter is exposed; the event is immutable by design (except for potential subclassing).

## 3. Functions/Methods

| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Returns | Side‑Effects |
|--------|---------|------------|---------|--------------|
| `DeleteProductVariantEvent(Object source, ProductVariant variant, Product product)` | Constructs the event; delegates product to `ProductEvent`. | `source` – event publisher; `variant` – the variant being deleted; `product` – parent product. | `DeleteProductVariantEvent` instance | None (except storing references). |
| `getVariant()` | Accessor for the deleted variant. | None | `ProductVariant` | None |

### Reusable / Utility Methods
- **None** – the class is intentionally lightweight.

## 4. Dependencies

| Library / Framework | Use | Type |
|---------------------|-----|------|
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.catalog.product.Product` | Domain model | Third‑party (project specific) |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.catalog.product.variant.ProductVariant` | Domain model | Third‑party |
| `ProductEvent` (parent class) | Base event functionality | Third‑party (project specific) |
| (Implicit) Spring Framework (`ApplicationEvent`) | Event publishing/handling | Third‑party |

No external APIs or platform‑specific dependencies are evident. The class relies solely on the project’s domain models and Spring’s event infrastructure.

## 5. Additional Notes

### Strengths
- **Simplicity & Clarity** – the event is straightforward, making it easy to understand and maintain.  
- **Consistency** – follows the pattern established by `ProductEvent`.  
- **Extensibility** – additional data could be added later without breaking existing listeners.

### Potential Improvements
| Area | Suggested Change | Rationale |
|------|------------------|-----------|
| **Null‑Safety** | Add `Objects.requireNonNull(variant, "variant must not be null")` (and similarly for product) | Prevents accidental null references and provides clear error messages. |
| **Immutability** | Declare `variant` as `final` | Guarantees the field cannot be reassigned after construction. |
| **Documentation** | Add Javadoc to class and constructor | Improves developer understanding and IDE tooling. |
| **Equality / Hashing** | Override `equals()` & `hashCode()` if the event might be stored or compared | Ensures correct behavior in collections or caches. |
| **String Representation** | Override `toString()` for debugging | Easier logging of event contents. |
| **Annotations** | Consider using Lombok (`@Getter`, `@RequiredArgsConstructor`) to reduce boilerplate | Keeps code concise while retaining readability. |

### Edge Cases & Scenarios Not Handled
- **Concurrent Deletions** – If two variants are deleted simultaneously, listeners must be idempotent.  
- **Serialization Across Process Boundaries** – Although the event is `Serializable`, custom serialization logic (e.g., for `ProductVariant`) may be required if the objects contain non‑serializable fields.  
- **Event Replay** – If events are stored for audit or replay, the current design may not include metadata such as timestamps or operation identifiers.

### Future Enhancements
- **Audit Information** – Add fields like `deletedBy` or `deletionTimestamp`.  
- **Batch Events** – Create a `DeleteProductVariantsEvent` to handle bulk deletions efficiently.  
- **Error Handling** – Provide mechanisms for listeners to report failures (e.g., using `ApplicationListener` that returns a status).  
- **Integration with Messaging** – Serialize the event for Kafka/RabbitMQ if cross‑service communication is needed.

---

**Verdict:**  
The `DeleteProductVariantEvent` is a clean, well‑structured component that fits neatly into an event‑driven architecture. Minor enhancements around null‑safety, immutability, and documentation would raise its robustness and maintainability, but the core implementation is sound.

public class DeleteProductVariantEvent extends ProductEvent {
	
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	private ProductVariant variant;

	public DeleteProductVariantEvent(Object source, ProductVariant variant, Product product) {
		super(source, product);
		this.variant = variant;
	}

	public ProductVariant getVariant() {
