# ProductImageRemove.java

## Review

## 1. Summary

**Purpose**  
The `ProductImageRemove` interface defines the contract for removing product images within the SalesManager CMS. It extends a generic `ImageRemove` interface, thereby inheriting common image‑removal operations while adding product‑specific removal logic.

**Key Components**  
- **`ProductImageRemove`** – Service‑level interface focused on product image deletion.  
- **`removeProductImage(ProductImage)`** – Deletes a single image.  
- **`removeProductImages(Product)`** – Deletes all images associated with a given product.  

**Notable Patterns & Libraries**  
- **Interface‑Based Design** – Encourages loose coupling and easy testing via mocks or stubs.  
- **Exception Handling** – Uses a custom `ServiceException` to surface business‑level errors.  
- **Domain‑Driven Design** – Operates on rich domain entities (`Product`, `ProductImage`).

## 2. Detailed Description

### Core Flow
1. **Client Call** – A higher‑level service (e.g., a controller or batch job) invokes one of the two removal methods.  
2. **Implementation** – The concrete class (not shown) will:
   - Validate the input (`Product` or `ProductImage`) – typically checking for `null`, existence, and permissions.  
   - Interact with persistence (JPA/Hibernate, Spring Data, or a DAO layer) to delete the image record.  
   - Potentially cascade the deletion to related resources (file system storage, cloud buckets, or CDN caches).  
3. **Exception Propagation** – Any lower‑level persistence or I/O exceptions are wrapped in `ServiceException` and re‑thrown.  

### Assumptions & Constraints
- **Transactional Context** – Implementations are expected to run within a transaction to ensure atomicity.  
- **Product–Image Relationship** – Assumes a one‑to‑many relationship (`Product` → `ProductImage`).  
- **Storage Backend** – The interface does not dictate how images are stored (local, S3, etc.); this is an implementation concern.  

### Architecture Choices
- **Separation of Concerns** – By isolating image removal into its own interface, the system can swap out implementations (e.g., from local storage to a remote microservice) without affecting consumers.  
- **Extensibility** – Adding new removal strategies (soft delete, scheduled deletion) only requires new implementations, not changes to the interface.

## 3. Functions/Methods

| Method | Signature | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Side‑Effects |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
| `removeProductImage` | `void removeProductImage(ProductImage productImage) throws ServiceException` | Deletes a single `ProductImage` entity. | `productImage` – must not be `null` and should represent a persistent image. | None – side effect is removal from the data store. | Persists deletion; may trigger cache invalidation or storage cleanup. |
| `removeProductImages` | `void removeProductImages(Product product) throws ServiceException` | Deletes all images linked to the provided `Product`. | `product` – must not be `null` and should represent a persistent product. | None – side effect is removal of all associated image records. | Batch delete; may trigger cleanup of storage resources; may involve cascading operations. |

### Reusable/Utility Methods
- None defined directly in this interface; however, the inherited `ImageRemove` interface may provide generic image operations (e.g., `removeImageById`, `removeImagesByPredicate`).

## 4. Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Comments |
|------------|------|----------|
| `com.salesmanager.core.business.exception.ServiceException` | Custom | Checked exception used across the service layer. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.business.modules.cms.common.ImageRemove` | Custom | Provides generic image removal contract. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.catalog.product.Product` | Custom | Domain entity representing a product. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.catalog.product.image.ProductImage` | Custom | Domain entity representing a product image. |

- **Third‑Party Libraries** – None are directly referenced in this interface; implementations will likely use JPA/Hibernate, Spring Data, or a custom DAO framework.  
- **Platform Assumptions** – The code is Java‑centric and intended to run in a JEE/Spring environment.

## 5. Additional Notes

### Edge Cases & Validation
- **Null Handling** – The interface documentation should explicitly state that passing `null` will result in a `ServiceException` or `NullPointerException`.  
- **Non‑existent Entities** – Implementations must decide whether to silently ignore missing images/products or throw an exception.  
- **Concurrent Modifications** – If multiple threads attempt to delete the same image, the implementation should be idempotent or handle optimistic locking failures gracefully.

### Design Recommendations
1. **Rename for Clarity**  
   - `ProductImageRemovalService` or `ProductImageService` could better convey that this is a service component rather than an action.  
2. **Method Consolidation**  
   - Consider a single method `removeProductImages(Collection<ProductImage>)` to unify single‑ and bulk‑removal logic.  
3. **Return Status**  
   - Returning a boolean or a count of deleted images could provide richer feedback to callers.  
4. **Optional Logging**  
   - Implementations should log deletion attempts, especially failures, for audit purposes.

### Potential Enhancements
- **Soft Delete Support** – Provide a flag or separate method to mark images as inactive instead of physical removal.  
- **Batch API** – Add `removeProductImages(List<Long> imageIds)` for performance in large catalog operations.  
- **Event Publication** – After deletion, publish an event (`ProductImageDeletedEvent`) for downstream systems (search indexing, analytics).  

Overall, the interface is clean and focused, enabling straightforward implementation and testing. Addressing the above suggestions would improve clarity, robustness, and extensibility in a production environment.
