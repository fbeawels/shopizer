# CustomerRepositoryCustom.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
The file defines **`CustomerRepositoryCustom`**, a Spring‑style repository interface intended to provide custom query capabilities for customer data.  
* **Purpose** – The repository is designed to fetch a paginated list of customers belonging to a specific `MerchantStore` while allowing additional filtering via a `CustomerCriteria` object.  
* **Key components**  
  * `listByStore(MerchantStore store, CustomerCriteria criteria)` – a single custom query method that returns a `CustomerList` object.  
* **Design patterns / frameworks** – The interface follows the *Custom Repository* pattern commonly used in Spring Data JPA, where the base repository (e.g., `JpaRepository`) is extended with a separate interface for non‑standard queries. The implementation of this interface would typically be named `CustomerRepositoryImpl` and annotated with `@Repository`.

## 2. Detailed Description  
1. **Architecture**  
   * The system appears to separate persistence concerns into layered packages (`repositories`, `model`).  
   * `CustomerRepositoryCustom` lives in the **`customer`** sub‑package, which suggests there is a companion `CustomerRepository` that extends Spring Data’s `JpaRepository<Customer, Long>` and then also extends this custom interface.  
   * The repository layer is responsible for data access; the custom interface allows developers to add queries that cannot be expressed with Spring Data’s derived query syntax.  

2. **Execution Flow**  
   * **Initialization** – Spring scans the package, creates a bean for `CustomerRepository` (and its implementation).  
   * **Runtime** – When a service layer calls `listByStore`, the actual implementation (likely a custom JPQL/Criteria query) executes against the database and populates a `CustomerList`.  
   * **Cleanup** – Managed by the Spring container (transactional boundaries, connection pooling).  

3. **Assumptions & Constraints**  
   * Assumes that a `CustomerList` encapsulates the results (potentially with pagination, sorting, total count).  
   * `MerchantStore` represents a tenant or brand context; the method requires that the caller passes a non‑null instance.  
   * `CustomerCriteria` probably contains filter fields (name, email, status, etc.).  
   * No explicit null checks or validation are present at this interface level; such checks would belong in the implementation or service layer.  

4. **Design Choices**  
   * **Separation of concerns** – By isolating custom queries into this interface, the code keeps the base repository clean and leverages Spring Data’s auto‑implementation for standard CRUD.  
   * **Extensibility** – Adding new custom queries can be done by extending this interface or by adding new methods to the base repository, keeping the interface lean.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Return | Side‑Effects | Notes |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|--------------|-------|
| `CustomerList listByStore(MerchantStore store, CustomerCriteria criteria)` | Retrieve a list of customers that belong to the supplied `MerchantStore`, optionally filtered by the given `CustomerCriteria`. | `store`: the merchant context; `criteria`: filtering options. | `CustomerList` – likely contains a collection of `Customer` objects, pagination metadata, etc. | No direct side‑effects; implementation should only read data. | Should be documented with JavaDoc explaining expected behaviour, possible exceptions, and the meaning of the `criteria` fields. |

**Reusable/utility methods** – None present; the interface defines a single operation, delegating any helper logic to the implementing class.

## 4. Dependencies  

| Category | Dependency | Remarks |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Standard Java** | `java.lang.*` | Implicit. |
| **Custom Domain Model** | `com.salesmanager.core.model.customer.CustomerCriteria`<br>`com.salesmanager.core.model.customer.CustomerList`<br>`com.salesmanager.core.model.merchant.MerchantStore` | Domain entities/DTOs defined elsewhere in the project. |
| **Spring Data / JPA** | *Not directly referenced in the interface* but implied by the package structure. The implementation would typically depend on `org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository`, `org.springframework.stereotype.Repository`, and JPA’s `EntityManager`. | None declared here. |
| **Frameworks** | Spring Framework (for DI, transaction management). | The interface itself is framework‑agnostic but is conventionally used within a Spring context. |

No external or platform‑specific libraries are referenced directly in this file.

## 5. Additional Notes  

### Edge Cases & Missing Validation  
* **Null Handling** – The interface does not specify whether `store` or `criteria` may be `null`. The implementation should defensively check and throw an informative `IllegalArgumentException` if either is required.  
* **Empty Criteria** – If `criteria` contains no filters, the query should default to returning all customers for the store; this behaviour should be clearly documented.  
* **Pagination** – If `CustomerList` contains pagination metadata, the method should allow the caller to specify page size/number via `CustomerCriteria`. If not, large result sets could cause memory issues.  

### Potential Enhancements  
1. **Add JavaDoc** – Provide clear documentation of method semantics, expected input constraints, and the structure of the returned `CustomerList`.  
2. **Return a `Page<Customer>`** – Instead of a custom `CustomerList`, consider returning Spring Data’s `Page<Customer>` to standardise pagination handling.  
3. **Exception Handling** – Define custom exceptions (e.g., `CustomerNotFoundException`, `InvalidCriteriaException`) to make error handling explicit.  
4. **Unit Tests** – A test harness should mock `EntityManager` or use an in‑memory database to verify that the query logic respects both `store` and `criteria`.  
5. **Performance** – If the query becomes complex, consider adding indexes on columns used in `CustomerCriteria` (e.g., email, status) or employing Spring Data JPA’s `@Query` annotation with native SQL for fine‑grained tuning.  

### Summary  
`CustomerRepositoryCustom` is a minimal, well‑structured contract for custom customer retrieval logic. While the interface is clean, its effectiveness depends heavily on the quality of the implementing class. Adding documentation, defensive coding, and consideration for pagination/validation will greatly improve its robustness and maintainability.
