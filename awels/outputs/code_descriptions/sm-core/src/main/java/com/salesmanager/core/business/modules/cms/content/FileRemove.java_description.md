# FileRemove.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
The `FileRemove` interface defines a contract for deleting CMS‑related files from a store’s static content repository. It is part of the `com.salesmanager.core.business.modules.cms.content` package and is used by the business layer to abstract away the underlying storage mechanics (local file system, cloud blob store, etc.).  

Key points:  
- **Two operations** – delete a single file or delete an entire folder (or a path prefix).  
- **Parameters** – require the merchant’s store code, file content type, and optionally a sub‑path.  
- **Exception handling** – throws a custom `ServiceException` to signal business‑level errors.  

No particular design patterns are visible in this snippet, but the interface itself encourages the *Strategy* or *Adapter* pattern: concrete implementations can swap storage back‑ends without changing the business code that calls these methods.

## 2. Detailed Description  

### Core Components
| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `FileRemove` | Interface defining file‑removal operations. |
| `removeFile` | Deletes one specific file. |
| `removeFiles` | Deletes all files under a given path (or root if `path` is empty). |
| `ServiceException` | Signals failure to the caller (e.g., permission denied, file not found, I/O error). |
| `FileContentType` | Enum describing the type of static content (e.g., `HTML`, `IMAGE`, `PDF`). |

### Execution Flow
1. **Caller** (e.g., a CMS controller or a scheduled job) resolves the merchant store code and optional path.  
2. **Implementation** (e.g., `FileRemoveLocalImpl`, `FileRemoveS3Impl`) receives the call.  
3. **Validation** – the implementation validates the arguments (non‑null store code, file name, content type, and that the file exists).  
4. **Deletion** – the file(s) are removed from the underlying storage.  
5. **Error Handling** – any I/O or business rule violations are wrapped in a `ServiceException`.  
6. **Return** – the method returns void; the caller infers success by the absence of an exception.

### Assumptions & Constraints
- **Optional Path** – If omitted, operations default to the root of the store’s static content area.  
- **Thread Safety** – Implementations must be safe for concurrent deletions if the system is multi‑threaded.  
- **Atomicity** – No guarantee that `removeFiles` is atomic across multiple files; callers may need to handle partial deletions.  

### Architecture & Design Choices
- The interface is intentionally minimal, focusing on *deletion* only. This keeps the contract simple and allows multiple implementations (file system, S3, Azure Blob).  
- The use of `Optional<String>` instead of a nullable `String` encourages explicit handling of “no path” cases.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Returns | Exceptions | Side Effects |
|--------|---------|------------|---------|------------|--------------|
| `removeFile` | Delete a single file belonging to a merchant store. | `merchantStoreCode` (String), `staticContentType` (FileContentType), `fileName` (String), `path` (Optional<String>) | void | `ServiceException` | Physical file removed from storage. |
| `removeFiles` | Delete all files under a given path for a merchant store. | `merchantStoreCode` (String), `path` (Optional<String>) | void | `ServiceException` | Batch removal of files. |

### Reusable / Utility Methods
There are no concrete methods in the interface, but typical implementations might expose utility helpers such as:
- `Path resolvePath(merchantStoreCode, staticContentType, path)` – build a fully‑qualified path.
- `boolean fileExists(...)` – used for pre‑check before deletion.

## 4. Dependencies  

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `com.salesmanager.core.business.exception.ServiceException` | Custom | Domain‑specific exception hierarchy. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.content.FileContentType` | Custom enum | Represents static content categories. |
| Java Standard Library | Optional | `java.util.Optional` used for nullable parameters. |
| (Implementation‑specific) | Third‑party | Concrete implementations might depend on libraries such as Apache Commons IO, AWS SDK, Azure SDK, etc. |

There are no platform‑specific dependencies declared in this interface; the actual implementation will decide the platform.

## 5. Additional Notes  

### Edge Cases & Limitations  
- **Null Parameters** – The interface allows null for `fileName` (but `merchantStoreCode` and `staticContentType` must not be null). Implementations should validate and throw `ServiceException` if any required argument is missing.  
- **Non‑existent Files** – Removing a file that does not exist should still be considered successful in many contexts, but the contract is silent on this. Clarify desired behavior.  
- **Concurrent Deletions** – If multiple threads try to delete the same file simultaneously, the underlying storage might throw an error; implementations should be idempotent.  
- **Large Deletion Sets** – `removeFiles` could trigger huge deletes; consider pagination or chunked deletes to avoid long‑running operations.

### Possible Enhancements  
1. **Return Status** – Add a return type (e.g., boolean or `DeleteResult`) to indicate success, number of files removed, or errors per file.  
2. **Logging** – Provide optional logging hooks or callback interfaces to trace deletions.  
3. **Batch API** – An overload that accepts a list of file names for bulk deletion.  
4. **Dry‑Run** – A flag or separate method to simulate deletion without actual I/O, useful for testing.  
5. **Event Publication** – Emit events (e.g., `FileDeletedEvent`) so other services can react (cache invalidation, analytics).  
6. **Security Checks** – Validate that the caller has permission to delete the specified store’s files.  

### Suggested Implementation Skeleton  

```java
public class FileRemoveLocalImpl implements FileRemove {

    @Override
    public void removeFile(String storeCode, FileContentType type,
                           String fileName, Optional<String> path) throws ServiceException {
        Path target = resolvePath(storeCode, type, path).resolve(fileName);
        try {
            Files.deleteIfExists(target);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new ServiceException("Failed to delete file: " + target, e);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void removeFiles(String storeCode, Optional<String> path) throws ServiceException {
        Path base = resolvePath(storeCode, null, path);
        try (Stream<Path> files = Files.walk(base)) {
            files.sorted(Comparator.reverseOrder())
                 .forEach(p -> {
                     try { Files.deleteIfExists(p); }
                     catch (IOException e) { /* handle */ }
                 });
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new ServiceException("Failed to delete files under: " + base, e);
        }
    }

    private Path resolvePath(String storeCode, FileContentType type, Optional<String> path) {
        // Example: /data/stores/<storeCode>/<type>/<path>
    }
}
```

This skeleton demonstrates how the interface can be implemented while respecting the optional path and handling I/O exceptions gracefully.

**Overall Assessment**  
The `FileRemove` interface is concise and well‑named, clearly expressing its intent. It provides a solid foundation for multiple storage back‑ends. The main improvement area is the handling of edge cases and the contract’s expressiveness regarding return values or status reporting. With the suggested enhancements, the interface could become even more robust and easier to integrate with other system components.
