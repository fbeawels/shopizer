# CustomerReviewService.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  

The code defines a **`CustomerReviewService`** interface that serves as a contract for managing customer review entities in a Sales Manager application.  
Key points:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `CustomerReviewService` | Declares CRUD‑like operations specific to `CustomerReview` objects. |
| `SalesManagerEntityService<Long, CustomerReview>` | Provides generic entity operations (save, delete, find, etc.) that `CustomerReviewService` inherits. |
| `getByCustomer`, `getByReviewedCustomer`, `getByReviewerAndReviewed` | Convenience query methods to retrieve reviews based on customer relationships. |

The design is typical of a **Service Layer** in a Spring‑based, domain‑driven architecture. The interface keeps the persistence details hidden from higher layers, allowing for flexible implementations (e.g., JPA, JDBC, or mock services for testing).

---

## 2. Detailed Description  

### Core Components & Interaction  

1. **Interface Declaration**  
   ```java
   public interface CustomerReviewService extends SalesManagerEntityService<Long, CustomerReview> { … }
   ```
   - The interface inherits standard CRUD methods from `SalesManagerEntityService`.  
   - All public methods are contract‑only; concrete implementations will provide persistence logic.

2. **Custom Query Methods**  
   - `List<CustomerReview> getByCustomer(Customer customer);`  
     Returns all reviews *written* by the specified customer.  
   - `List<CustomerReview> getByReviewedCustomer(Customer customer);`  
     Returns all reviews *received* by the specified customer.  
   - `CustomerReview getByReviewerAndReviewed(Long reviewer, Long reviewed);`  
     Retrieves a single review where a particular reviewer commented on a particular reviewed customer.

3. **Execution Flow**  
   - **Initialization** – A concrete class implementing this interface will be instantiated by a Spring container (or another DI framework).  
   - **Runtime** – When any of these methods is invoked, the implementation will query the data store (e.g., a JPA `EntityManager` or a repository) and return the results.  
   - **Cleanup** – Any resources (EntityManager, JDBC connections) are managed by the container; the interface itself does not handle cleanup.

### Assumptions & Constraints  

| Assumption | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| `Customer` and `CustomerReview` are fully defined domain models | Required for type safety |
| The data store supports queries by customer and reviewer IDs | Necessary for implementation of the three methods |
| `CustomerReview` IDs are `Long` | Matches the generic type of `SalesManagerEntityService` |
| Methods return `List` and `CustomerReview` directly | Caller must handle null/empty cases |

### Architecture & Design Choices  

- **Service Layer Separation** – Keeps business logic and data access logic isolated.  
- **Generic Base Service** – Reduces boilerplate by reusing CRUD operations across entity services.  
- **Method Naming** – Follows Java Bean conventions (`getBy…`), making the interface intuitive.  
- **Use of Domain Objects** – Passes domain entities (`Customer`) directly instead of primitive IDs for readability, except in `getByReviewerAndReviewed` where IDs are used—this inconsistency may be intentional to avoid circular dependencies but could be unified.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Signature | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Side Effects |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
| `List<CustomerReview> getByCustomer(Customer customer)` | Retrieves all reviews authored by the given customer. | Allows clients to view what a customer has said about others. | `Customer customer` – the author of reviews. | `List<CustomerReview>` – may be empty if none found. | None beyond data access. |
| `List<CustomerReview> getByReviewedCustomer(Customer customer)` | Retrieves all reviews directed at the given customer. | Enables a customer to see what others think of them. | `Customer customer` – the target of reviews. | `List<CustomerReview>` – may be empty if none found. | None beyond data access. |
| `CustomerReview getByReviewerAndReviewed(Long reviewer, Long reviewed)` | Retrieves the unique review created by `reviewer` for `reviewed`. | Useful for checking if a review already exists or retrieving its details. | `Long reviewer` – ID of the author. `Long reviewed` – ID of the target. | `CustomerReview` – null if not found. | None beyond data access. |

**Reusable / Utility Methods** – None defined directly in this interface; they would come from `SalesManagerEntityService`.

## 4. Dependencies  

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `com.salesmanager.core.business.services.common.generic.SalesManagerEntityService` | External (within the same project) | Generic CRUD service providing `save`, `delete`, `findById`, etc. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.customer.Customer` | Domain model | Represents a customer entity. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.customer.review.CustomerReview` | Domain model | Represents a review entity. |
| Java Collections (`java.util.List`) | Standard | Used for return types. |

All dependencies are **project‑specific**; no external frameworks (Spring, Hibernate) are referenced directly, which keeps the interface framework‑agnostic. Concrete implementations would typically depend on Spring Data or JPA.

---

## 5. Additional Notes  

### Edge Cases & Potential Issues  

1. **Null Handling** – The interface does not specify whether passing `null` for any parameter is allowed. Implementations should guard against `NullPointerException` or define a contract via JavaDoc/annotations (`@Nonnull`).  
2. **Return Types** – Returning `null` for `getByReviewerAndReviewed` could be ambiguous. Consider returning `Optional<CustomerReview>` to express absence explicitly.  
3. **Method Consistency** – Two methods accept a `Customer` object, while the third accepts raw IDs. For consistency, either all should use `Customer` or all should use IDs, unless there is a clear rationale.  
4. **Ordering & Pagination** – The list-returning methods have no pagination support; for large datasets, this could lead to memory issues. Future iterations might add `PageRequest` or similar parameters.  
5. **Security / Validation** – The interface does not declare any authorization checks. Implementations must enforce that only the rightful owner or privileged roles can access certain reviews.  

### Future Enhancements  

- **Default Methods** – Add default implementations for common queries using the base service, reducing boilerplate in concrete classes.  
- **Cache Support** – Introduce caching annotations or method variants that return cached results.  
- **DTO Support** – Provide overloads that return Data Transfer Objects instead of entity objects to decouple API consumers from persistence models.  
- **Batch Operations** – Methods to fetch reviews for a collection of customers (e.g., `List<CustomerReview> getByCustomers(List<Customer> customers)`).  

### Summary of Recommendations  

| Recommendation | Why | Suggested Change |
|----------------|-----|------------------|
| Add nullability annotations | Improves API clarity | `public List<CustomerReview> getByCustomer(@NonNull Customer customer)` |
| Use `Optional` for single entity lookup | Explicit absence handling | `Optional<CustomerReview> getByReviewerAndReviewed(Long reviewer, Long reviewed)` |
| Standardize parameter types | Reduces confusion | Convert ID-based method to accept `Customer` or vice‑versa |
| Add JavaDoc for null/empty cases | Better documentation | Document return semantics in method javadoc |
| Consider pagination | Avoid large lists | Add `Pageable` or offset/limit parameters |

Overall, the interface is clean, well‑named, and aligns with common Java service‑layer patterns. Minor adjustments around null handling, consistency, and future‑proofing would make it even more robust.
