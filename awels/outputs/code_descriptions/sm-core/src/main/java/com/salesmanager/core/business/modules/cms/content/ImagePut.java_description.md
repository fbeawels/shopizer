# ImagePut.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
The file defines a **`ImagePut`** interface that represents a contract for uploading images to a CMS (Content Management System) that is part of the SalesManager core business layer.  

### Key points  
* **Purpose** – Expose two operations:  
  * `addImage` – upload a single image.  
  * `addImages` – upload a batch of images.  
* **Input type** – `InputContentFile`, a domain object that encapsulates the raw file and metadata.  
* **Error handling** – Both methods declare `throws ServiceException`, indicating that any failure during the upload process will be surfaced as a checked exception.  
* **Frameworks / Patterns** – The interface follows the *Service* design pattern (separation of business logic from controllers/DAOs). No concrete framework dependencies are visible in the code itself.

## 2. Detailed Description  

### 2.1 Core Components  
| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `ImagePut` | Service contract for image persistence. |
| `InputContentFile` | DTO that carries file data and possibly attributes such as MIME type, name, size, etc. |
| `ServiceException` | Unified exception type for business‑level errors. |

### 2.2 Interaction Flow  
1. **Client** (e.g., a REST controller or another service) receives a request to upload an image.  
2. The client obtains an implementation of `ImagePut` (likely via dependency injection).  
3. The client calls `addImage` or `addImages` passing the merchant store code and the file(s).  
4. The implementation (not shown) validates the store code, processes the `InputContentFile` objects (e.g., checks size, MIME type, stores to DB or file system), and throws `ServiceException` if any step fails.  
5. The client handles the exception, converting it into an appropriate HTTP status or UI feedback.

### 2.3 Assumptions & Constraints  
* The `merchantStoreCode` is a unique identifier for the store that owns the images.  
* The interface does not dictate how images are stored; this is left to concrete implementations.  
* The operations are synchronous and blocking.  
* No concurrency controls are declared at the interface level; implementations must decide how to handle concurrent uploads.  

### 2.4 Architecture & Design Choices  
* **Interface‑First** – By exposing only an interface, the code promotes loose coupling and allows multiple implementations (e.g., local file storage, cloud blob storage).  
* **Checked Exception** – Using `ServiceException` forces callers to handle errors explicitly, which can be beneficial for reliability but may lead to boilerplate code.  
* **Batch Support** – The `addImages` method accepts a `List`, encouraging bulk uploads to reduce round‑trips.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Signature | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Side‑Effects |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
| `addImage` | `void addImage(String merchantStoreCode, InputContentFile image) throws ServiceException` | Uploads a single image. | *`merchantStoreCode`* – identifier for the target store.<br>*`image`* – the file to persist. | None (void). | Persists the image; may throw `ServiceException` on failure. |
| `addImages` | `void addImages(String merchantStoreCode, List<InputContentFile> imagesList) throws ServiceException` | Bulk upload of images. | *`merchantStoreCode`* – target store.<br>*`imagesList`* – collection of images. | None (void). | Persists each image in the list; may throw `ServiceException` on failure (potentially partial). |

### Reusable / Utility Methods  
* The interface itself is minimal; any reusable logic would reside in the concrete implementation (e.g., validation, conversion, storage adapters).

## 4. Dependencies  

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `com.salesmanager.core.business.exception.ServiceException` | Third‑party (SalesManager‑specific) | Centralised business exception type. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.content.InputContentFile` | Third‑party (SalesManager domain) | Encapsulates file data. |
| Java Collections (`List`) | Standard Java | Used for batch uploads. |
| No external frameworks (e.g., Spring, JPA) are referenced directly in this interface, keeping it framework‑agnostic. |

## 5. Additional Notes  

### 5.1 Edge Cases & Missing Considerations  
* **Null arguments** – The interface does not specify whether `null` is allowed for the `merchantStoreCode`, `image`, or `imagesList`. Implementations should guard against `NullPointerException`.  
* **Empty image list** – `addImages` should define behavior when `imagesList` is empty (no‑op vs. exception).  
* **Partial failure** – In bulk uploads, if one image fails, the method currently throws a single `ServiceException`. Implementations may want to report per‑image status or support transactional rollback.  
* **Large file handling** – The interface does not specify streaming or size limits; large uploads might exceed memory if the implementation buffers the entire file.  
* **Security** – No checks for file type, size, or potential injection attacks are present at the contract level.  

### 5.2 Potential Enhancements  
1. **Return Types** – Instead of `void`, return a status object (e.g., `ImageUploadResult`) containing IDs, URLs, or error details.  
2. **Batch Response** – Provide per‑image success/failure info for `addImages`.  
3. **Asynchronous Support** – Expose async variants returning `CompletableFuture<Void>` or a reactive stream.  
4. **Validation Annotations** – Use JSR‑380 (`@NotNull`, `@Size`, etc.) to document pre‑conditions.  
5. **Documentation** – Javadoc comments would clarify method contracts, expected behavior on invalid input, and example usage.  
6. **Extensibility** – Add a method to delete or update images, or to query image metadata.  

### 5.3 Security & Compliance  
If the images are user‑supplied, consider adding methods to validate MIME types, scan for malware, or enforce size limits.  

---

### Overall Verdict  
The `ImagePut` interface is concise, clear, and follows good design practices by isolating business operations from concrete storage mechanics. While the current design is functional for basic image uploads, documenting contract expectations (nullability, batch semantics) and providing richer return types would improve usability and robustness for downstream consumers.
