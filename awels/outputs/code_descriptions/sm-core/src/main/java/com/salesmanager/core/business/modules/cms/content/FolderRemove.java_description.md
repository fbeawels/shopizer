# FolderRemove.java

## Review

## 1. Summary
The snippet is a **Java interface** that declares a single contract: removing a folder within a CMS (Content Management System) for a merchant store.  
- **Purpose:** Expose a service‑level operation that deletes a folder identified by its name (and optionally a path) within the context of a specific store (`merchantStoreCode`).  
- **Key components:**  
  - `removeFolder(...)` – the sole method that must be implemented by any concrete class.  
- **Design patterns / frameworks:**  
  - The interface follows the *Service Layer* pattern, separating business logic from data access or persistence layers.  
  - The use of `Optional<String>` for the folder path suggests a Java‑8‑style API design that encourages explicit handling of potentially missing values.  

## 2. Detailed Description
### Core components
| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `FolderRemove` interface | Defines the contract for folder deletion operations. |
| `removeFolder(...)` method | Receives context (`merchantStoreCode`, `folderName`) and optional additional context (`folderPath`). Throws `ServiceException` on failure. |

### Execution flow (conceptual)
1. **Invocation:** A client (e.g., a controller or another service) calls `removeFolder`.
2. **Processing:**  
   - The concrete implementation would validate the input (non‑null, non‑empty strings, allowed characters, etc.).  
   - Resolve the absolute folder location, likely by combining `merchantStoreCode`, `folderName`, and the optional `folderPath`.  
   - Interact with the underlying storage (file system, database, or remote service) to delete the folder.  
3. **Error handling:** Any failure (e.g., folder not found, permission issues, I/O errors) should be wrapped in a `ServiceException`.  
4. **Completion:** The method returns `void`; success is implied by the absence of an exception.

### Assumptions & constraints
- **Merchant context**: The folder hierarchy is scoped per `merchantStoreCode`.  
- **Folder identification**: `folderName` must uniquely identify a folder within the optional path.  
- **Optional path**: If omitted, the folder is assumed to reside in a default location for the store.  
- **Thread‑safety**: The interface itself is stateless, but concrete implementations must ensure safe concurrent deletes.  

### Architecture & design choices
- **Interface‑only design**: Encourages multiple implementations (e.g., local file system, cloud storage, test stubs).  
- **Explicit exception**: Using a domain‑specific `ServiceException` isolates business‑level errors from lower‑level ones.  
- **Java 8+ `Optional`**: Makes the presence/absence of `folderPath` explicit, reducing `null`‑related bugs.  

## 3. Functions/Methods
| Method | Signature | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Side Effects |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
| `removeFolder` | `void removeFolder(final String merchantStoreCode, String folderName, Optional<String> folderPath) throws ServiceException` | Delete a folder belonging to a store, optionally within a sub‑path. | - `merchantStoreCode`: identifier for the store.<br>- `folderName`: name of the folder to delete.<br>- `folderPath`: optional path relative to the store root. | `void` – completion implied by lack of exception. | Deletes folder from storage; may alter file system or database state. |

### Reusable / utility aspects
- The method signature is generic enough to be used across multiple concrete classes.  
- By accepting `Optional<String>`, callers can avoid passing `null` and benefit from clearer API contracts.

## 4. Dependencies
| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `java.util.Optional` | Standard | Java 8+ feature for optional values. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.business.exception.ServiceException` | Custom | Domain‑specific exception that likely extends `Exception` or `RuntimeException`. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.business.modules.cms.content` (package) | Project | Indicates the method belongs to the CMS module. |

No external frameworks (e.g., Spring) are referenced directly, but the interface could be used within such frameworks.

## 5. Additional Notes
### Edge cases & potential pitfalls
- **Missing folder:** If the folder does not exist, the implementation must decide whether to silently ignore, throw a `ServiceException`, or return a specific status.  
- **Permission issues:** Deleting folders may require elevated privileges; the method should handle security exceptions gracefully.  
- **Path traversal:** Concatenating `folderPath` and `folderName` must be sanitized to avoid directory traversal vulnerabilities.  
- **Concurrent deletes:** Two concurrent calls targeting the same folder could race; proper synchronization or atomic delete operations are needed.  

### Possible enhancements
- **Return type:** Instead of `void`, returning a boolean or a result object could provide explicit confirmation of deletion.  
- **Bulk deletion:** Add methods to delete multiple folders or entire paths recursively.  
- **Logging/metrics:** Embed hooks for audit logging or performance monitoring.  
- **Validation helpers:** Provide default validation utilities for `merchantStoreCode` and `folderName`.  

Overall, the interface is clean, concise, and follows good Java design practices. It serves as a solid foundation for concrete implementations that will interact with various storage back‑ends while keeping business logic decoupled from persistence concerns.
