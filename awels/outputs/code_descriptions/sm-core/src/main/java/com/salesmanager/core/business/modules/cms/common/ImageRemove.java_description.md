# ImageRemove.java

## Review

## 1. Summary
The snippet defines a **single‑method interface** (`ImageRemove`) inside the CMS module of the `salesmanager` application.  
Its sole responsibility is to expose a contract for removing all images associated with a given merchant store code. The method can fail with a domain‑specific `ServiceException`.

**Key points**

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `ImageRemove` | A contract for image removal services. |
| `removeImages(String)` | Operation that deletes all images for a store. |
| `ServiceException` | Custom exception type indicating a business‑level failure. |

The interface is intentionally minimal; implementation details (file system, database, cloud storage) are hidden behind the contract.

## 2. Detailed Description
### Core components
- **Interface**: `ImageRemove` is defined in `com.salesmanager.core.business.modules.cms.common`.
- **Method**: `removeImages(String merchantStoreCode)` accepts a merchant identifier and performs a delete operation. It throws `ServiceException` to signal issues such as I/O errors, authorization failures, or data consistency problems.

### Flow of execution
1. **Client** (e.g., a higher‑level service or controller) obtains an implementation of `ImageRemove`.
2. **Invocation**: `removeImages("STORE_XYZ")` is called.
3. **Implementation**: The concrete class resolves the store code, locates all image references, and deletes them (file removal, DB cleanup, cache eviction, etc.).
4. **Error handling**: If anything goes wrong, a `ServiceException` is propagated upward, allowing the caller to translate it into an HTTP error or a business‑logic failure.

There is no explicit cleanup logic in the interface itself; it is delegated to the concrete implementation.

### Assumptions & constraints
- The merchant store code is a non‑null, non‑empty string identifying a single store.
- Implementations are expected to handle all underlying storage mechanisms; the interface does not prescribe a particular storage technology.
- The caller must be aware that the operation is destructive and may have side effects (e.g., cascading deletions).

### Architecture
This interface follows the **Strategy** design pattern: different implementations can be swapped at runtime (e.g., local file system vs. cloud storage) while the rest of the system remains agnostic. It also loosely couples the image removal logic from the rest of the CMS module.

## 3. Functions/Methods
| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Return | Exceptions | Side‑effects |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|------------|--------------|
| `removeImages(String merchantStoreCode)` | Delete *all* images belonging to the specified merchant store. | `merchantStoreCode` – Identifier of the store. | `void` – no return value. | `ServiceException` – thrown on failure. | Removes image files, database records, cache entries, etc. |

### Reusable utilities
None directly in this interface; it simply declares a contract. Implementations may provide helper methods (e.g., validation, logging) but those are not part of the interface.

## 4. Dependencies
| Dependency | Type | Comments |
|------------|------|----------|
| `com.salesmanager.core.business.exception.ServiceException` | Third‑party (within the same project) | Custom runtime exception used throughout the application to signal service‑level errors. |
| Java Standard Library | Standard | No external frameworks referenced directly. |

The interface itself has no platform‑specific dependencies, but implementations will likely depend on file I/O libraries, database access (JPA/Hibernate), or cloud SDKs.

## 5. Additional Notes
### Documentation & clarity
- **Missing Javadoc**: The interface and its method lack documentation. Adding JavaDoc with a description of the contract, input expectations, and exception semantics would greatly improve maintainability.
- **Naming**: `ImageRemove` could be renamed to `ImageRemovalService` or `ImageCleaner` for greater clarity, especially if the interface is used as a Spring bean.

### Edge cases & error handling
- **Null or empty `merchantStoreCode`**: Current contract does not forbid these values; implementations should validate and throw a `ServiceException` or an `IllegalArgumentException`.
- **Partial failures**: If the deletion process is multi‑step (e.g., database then filesystem), consider transactional guarantees or idempotency to avoid leaving the system in an inconsistent state.

### Potential enhancements
- **Return type**: Instead of `void`, returning a result object (`ImageRemovalResult`) that contains counts of deleted items, skipped items, or a success flag can provide richer feedback to callers.
- **Asynchronous execution**: A default method returning a `CompletableFuture<Void>` could enable non‑blocking invocation for long‑running deletions.
- **Batching / filtering**: Expose additional parameters to delete only specific image types or date ranges.

### Integration points
- If the application uses a dependency injection framework (e.g., Spring), marking the interface with `@FunctionalInterface` (though optional) could hint at lambda compatibility and improve readability.

Overall, the interface is clean and minimal, which is appropriate for a small contract. Enhancing documentation and considering the points above would make it more robust and easier to maintain as the project evolves.
