# EmailModule.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
The snippet defines a **Java interface** named `EmailModule` that outlines the contract for any email‑sending component in the `com.salesmanager.core.business.modules.email` package.  

* **Purpose** – To decouple the rest of the system from the concrete implementation of email delivery.  
* **Key methods**  
  * `send(Email email)` – instructs the module to dispatch an `Email` instance.  
  * `setEmailConfig(EmailConfig emailConfig)` – injects configuration details (SMTP host, port, credentials, etc.).  
* **Design style** – Plain POJO interface; no frameworks or patterns beyond standard Java EE / Spring dependency injection are implied.  

## 2. Detailed Description  
### Core Components  
1. **EmailModule (interface)** – Defines the operations that an email service must provide.  
2. **Email** – A domain object (not shown) representing the email content (subject, body, recipients).  
3. **EmailConfig** – A configuration holder (also not shown) for SMTP or other transport settings.

### Interaction Flow  
1. **Configuration Phase** – An implementation receives an `EmailConfig` instance via `setEmailConfig`.  
2. **Runtime** – The rest of the application obtains an `EmailModule` implementation (e.g., via Spring `@Autowired` or manual instantiation) and calls `send(email)` whenever an email needs to be dispatched.  
3. **Cleanup** – Not specified; any resource cleanup (e.g., closing sockets) would be handled internally by the implementation.

### Assumptions & Constraints  
* **Exception handling** – `send` declares a generic `Exception`, implying the implementation may throw checked exceptions such as `MessagingException`, `IOException`, etc.  
* **Single configuration** – The interface assumes a one‑time or occasional configuration set. It does not expose methods to update or clear the configuration.  
* **Thread‑safety** – No guarantees are made; implementations must decide if they are thread‑safe.

### Architectural Choices  
* **Interface‑oriented design** – Encourages loose coupling and easy swapping of implementations (e.g., JavaMail, SendGrid, SMTP stub for tests).  
* **Separation of concerns** – Configuration is injected separately from the send operation, allowing for dynamic changes without recreating the module.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Signature | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Side Effects |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
| `void send(Email email) throws Exception` | Dispatches an email. | The core action of the module: send the provided `Email`. | `Email email` – fully populated email object. | None (void) | Throws a checked exception on failure; may alter internal state (e.g., increment counters). |
| `void setEmailConfig(EmailConfig emailConfig)` | Configures the module. | Supplies SMTP/transport settings. | `EmailConfig emailConfig` – configuration parameters. | None | Stores configuration internally; may reinitialize connection pools. |

*Reusable/Utility Methods:*  
None are present in this interface. Utility functions would be part of concrete implementations or helper classes.

## 4. Dependencies  
| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `Email` | Domain object (likely a POJO) | Represents email payload; must be serializable to the chosen transport. |
| `EmailConfig` | Domain object | Holds configuration details; could map to `javax.mail.Session` properties. |
| None other | | The interface itself is framework‑agnostic. Concrete implementations may rely on libraries such as JavaMail, Spring `MailSender`, or third‑party services. |

No platform‑specific or external API is mandated by the interface.

## 5. Additional Notes  

### Edge Cases  
* **Null inputs** – The interface does not specify behavior for `null` `email` or `emailConfig`. Implementations should defensively handle or document these scenarios.  
* **Reconfiguration** – Multiple calls to `setEmailConfig` could lead to resource leaks if the implementation does not clean up previous connections.  
* **Concurrent sends** – Without thread‑safety guarantees, concurrent `send` calls could interleave or corrupt internal state.  

### Potential Enhancements  
1. **Return type** – Consider returning a result or status object (`EmailSendResult`) to provide richer feedback (e.g., success/failure, message ID).  
2. **Unchecked exceptions** – Use a custom runtime exception (`EmailSendException`) to avoid forcing callers to catch generic `Exception`.  
3. **Batch sending** – Add a method to send a collection of emails atomically or in parallel.  
4. **Configuration updates** – Expose a method to clear or refresh configuration at runtime.  
5. **Async support** – Provide a default asynchronous implementation or return a `Future`/`CompletableFuture`.  

Overall, the interface is concise and aligns with standard Java practices for service contracts. It serves as a solid foundation for diverse email‑delivery implementations while keeping the rest of the system agnostic to the underlying transport mechanism.
