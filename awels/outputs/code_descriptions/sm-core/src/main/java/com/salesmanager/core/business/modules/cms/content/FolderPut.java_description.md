# FolderPut.java

## Review

## 1. Summary

The file defines a **`FolderPut`** interface in the `com.salesmanager.core.business.modules.cms.content` package.  
Its sole responsibility is to expose a contract for creating a new folder either at the root of a merchant store or within a specific sub‑path. The interface contains one method, `addFolder`, which takes the merchant store code, the folder name, and an optional path argument, and may throw a `ServiceException` when the operation fails.

**Key points**

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `FolderPut` | Service contract for folder creation |
| `addFolder(...)` | Adds a folder; may throw a domain‑specific exception |

The design follows a simple **service‑interface** pattern commonly used in Spring‑based applications, where concrete implementations are injected into controllers or other services. No frameworks are explicitly referenced in the interface itself, but the presence of a custom `ServiceException` hints at a typical business‑logic layer used in the SalesManager core module.

## 2. Detailed Description

### Core components

1. **Package** – `com.salesmanager.core.business.modules.cms.content`  
   This places the interface within the CMS (Content Management System) module of the SalesManager core business layer.

2. **Interface** – `FolderPut`  
   Declares a single operation for creating folders. Being an interface, it allows multiple implementations (e.g., local file system, cloud storage, database‑backed repository) to adhere to the same contract.

3. **Method** – `addFolder(String merchantStoreCode, String folderName, Optional<String> path)`  
   * **Parameters**  
     - `merchantStoreCode` – Identifier for the merchant store; used to determine the root location.  
     - `folderName` – Desired name of the folder to create.  
     - `path` – Optional relative path inside the merchant’s root where the folder should be created.  
   * **Behavior**  
     - If `path` is empty, the folder is created at the root.  
     - If `path` contains a value, the folder is created under that path (e.g., `/images/gallery`).  
   * **Exception**  
     - `ServiceException` is thrown if the operation fails (e.g., insufficient permissions, invalid name, I/O error).

### Execution flow (typical usage)

1. **Dependency Injection** – A concrete class implementing `FolderPut` (e.g., `FileSystemFolderPut`) is injected into a controller or another service.
2. **Invocation** – The client calls `addFolder(...)` providing the merchant code, folder name, and an `Optional` path.
3. **Implementation** – The concrete class resolves the full path, validates inputs, checks for existence, creates the directory, and handles errors by wrapping them in `ServiceException`.
4. **Return** – The method is `void`; success is inferred from the absence of an exception.

### Assumptions & constraints

| Assumption | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|
| The caller knows the merchant store code and its mapping to a physical or logical root. | Needed to locate the correct base directory. |
| The `folderName` is a valid, non‑empty string. | Basic validation is expected in implementation. |
| The `path` may be absent or present but is relative to the merchant root. | Enables flexibility for deep hierarchies. |
| The method may be called concurrently; the implementation must handle race conditions. | Concurrency safety is outside the interface but should be documented. |

### Architectural choices

- **Interface‑only design**: Keeps business logic decoupled from infrastructure.  
- **`Optional` parameter**: Expresses the “optional” nature of the path without requiring overloaded methods.  
- **Custom exception**: Provides a consistent error handling strategy across the application.

## 3. Functions/Methods

| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Return | Side‑Effects | Notes |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|--------------|-------|
| `addFolder(String merchantStoreCode, String folderName, Optional<String> path)` | Creates a folder under the specified merchant store, optionally within a sub‑path. | * `merchantStoreCode` – merchant identifier.<br>* `folderName` – name of new folder.<br>* `path` – `Optional` relative path inside the merchant root. | `void` | May create a directory in the file system or a corresponding entity in a persistence store. | Throws `ServiceException` on failure. |

**Utility aspects**

- The method signature is intentionally minimal, making it easy for other components (controllers, service layers) to depend on it without needing to know implementation details.

---

## 4. Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `java.util.Optional` | Standard Java | Expresses optional argument. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.business.exception.ServiceException` | Custom | Domain‑specific exception used throughout the SalesManager core. |
| (None further) | | The interface itself has no external library dependencies. |

If a concrete implementation uses, for example, Spring’s `@Service` or `java.nio.file`, those would be additional dependencies but are not part of the interface contract.

## 5. Additional Notes

### Strengths
- **Simplicity & clarity**: A single, well‑documented method with clear semantics.  
- **Decoupling**: The interface allows different storage backends without changing the contract.  
- **Use of `Optional`**: Signals optionality explicitly, reducing the risk of `NullPointerException`.

### Potential Improvements
1. **Return Value**  
   - Consider returning the full path of the created folder or a boolean indicating success. This could aid in logging or subsequent operations.  
2. **Parameter Validation**  
   - Document expected constraints on `merchantStoreCode` and `folderName` (e.g., non‑null, allowed characters).  
3. **Method Overloading**  
   - Provide an overloaded method that accepts a plain `String` path (or null) for convenience, while internally delegating to the `Optional` version.  
4. **Error Categorization**  
   - The `ServiceException` could carry an error code or enum to distinguish between validation errors, permission issues, and I/O failures.  
5. **Thread‑Safety**  
   - If concurrent folder creation is expected, specify whether the implementation must be thread‑safe or if external synchronization is required.

### Edge Cases
- **Empty `folderName`**: Implementation should reject or sanitize.  
- **Invalid characters** in `folderName` or `path` (e.g., `/`, `\`, `?`, `*`).  
- **Path traversal**: Prevent `"../"` patterns that could escape the merchant root.  
- **Existing folder**: Decide whether to overwrite, throw, or silently ignore.  
- **Permission issues**: Must surface meaningful errors via `ServiceException`.  

### Future Enhancements
- **Batch creation**: A method to create multiple folders in a single call.  
- **Permissions/ACL**: Optionally set access controls upon creation.  
- **Event publishing**: Emit events (e.g., `FolderCreatedEvent`) to integrate with a broader event‑driven architecture.  
- **Support for cloud storage**: Abstract path handling so that implementations can target AWS S3, Azure Blob, etc.  

Overall, the interface provides a solid foundation for folder management within the SalesManager CMS. By addressing the suggestions above, it can become more robust, expressive, and easier to integrate across different parts of the system.

import java.util.Optional;

import com.salesmanager.core.business.exception.ServiceException;


public interface FolderPut {
	
	
  /**
   * Create folder on root or on specific path
   * @param merchantStoreCode
   * @param folderName
   * @param path
   * @throws ServiceException
   */
  void addFolder(final String merchantStoreCode, String folderName, Optional<String> path)
      throws ServiceException;

}
