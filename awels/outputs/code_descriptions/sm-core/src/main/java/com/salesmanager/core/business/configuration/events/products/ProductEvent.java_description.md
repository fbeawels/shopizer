# ProductEvent.java

## Review

## 1. Summary
- **Purpose**: The `ProductEvent` class defines a base event type for any action related to a `Product` within the Sales Manager application. It extends Spring’s `ApplicationEvent`, enabling the event to be published and listened to by the Spring event framework.
- **Key Components**:
  - **ProductEvent** (abstract): Holds a `Product` instance and provides accessor logic.
  - **Product** (model): Represents the domain object that the event concerns.
- **Design Patterns & Libraries**:
  - Utilises Spring’s **Event‑Driven Architecture** via `ApplicationEvent`.
  - Follows a **Template Method**‑like pattern where concrete events extend this abstract class and provide specific event semantics.

## 2. Detailed Description
### Core Components & Interaction
| Component | Responsibility | Interaction |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| `ProductEvent` | Base event class for product‑related actions. | Concrete events (e.g., `ProductCreatedEvent`, `ProductUpdatedEvent`) extend this class. |
| `Product` | Domain model representing a product. | Embedded within the event to carry the payload. |

### Execution Flow
1. **Instantiation**: When a product‑related action occurs (e.g., creation, update, deletion), a concrete subclass of `ProductEvent` is instantiated, passing the action source and the affected `Product` object.
2. **Publishing**: The event is published via Spring’s `ApplicationEventPublisher`.  
   ```java
   applicationEventPublisher.publishEvent(new ProductCreatedEvent(this, product));
   ```
3. **Handling**: Listeners annotated with `@EventListener` receive the event and can react accordingly (e.g., updating caches, sending notifications).

### Assumptions & Constraints
- **Serializability**: `serialVersionUID` is defined, implying the class may be serialized (e.g., for distributed event handling).
- **Immutability**: The `product` field is not exposed for mutation; only a getter is provided, preserving event immutability.
- **Single Payload**: Each event carries only one `Product`. Complex events requiring multiple payloads should extend this class differently.

### Architecture & Design Choices
- The abstract base class centralises common behaviour (holding the product and the event source), reducing duplication across concrete events.
- Extending `ApplicationEvent` leverages Spring’s built‑in event infrastructure, ensuring decoupled communication without explicit wiring.
- Declaring the class as **abstract** signals that it is meant only as a base; concrete events will implement specific semantics.

## 3. Functions/Methods
| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Return | Side Effects |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|--------------|
| `ProductEvent(Object source, Product product)` (constructor) | Initializes the event with its source and payload. | `source` – the object that published the event.<br>`product` – the product involved. | N/A (initialises instance) | Stores `product` in a private field. |
| `Product getProduct()` | Accessor to retrieve the product attached to the event. | None | `Product` instance | None |

### Reusable/Utility Methods
- The getter is the sole reusable method. All logic is straightforward and side‑effect free, making the class safe for concurrent use.

## 4. Dependencies
| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `org.springframework.context.ApplicationEvent` | Third‑party (Spring Framework) | Provides the base class for Spring events. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.catalog.product.Product` | In‑house | Domain model representing a product. |
| Java Serialization (`serialVersionUID`) | Standard | Enables potential event serialization. |

- No platform‑specific assumptions; the code is pure Java/Spring and should run on any JVM that hosts the Sales Manager application.

## 5. Additional Notes
### Edge Cases & Limitations
- **Null Product**: The constructor does not guard against `product == null`. While acceptable if the domain guarantees a non‑null product, defensive checks could prevent downstream `NullPointerException`s in listeners.
- **Multiple Payloads**: If an event requires more than one piece of data (e.g., product + context), the current design forces separate events or a wrapper, which could be less clean.
- **Thread Safety**: The class is immutable after construction; thread‑safety is guaranteed for the `product` reference.

### Future Enhancements
1. **Null‑Check Validation**: Add a guard or use `Objects.requireNonNull` to enforce non‑null payloads.
2. **Generic Payload Support**: Introduce a generic type parameter to allow different payloads without multiple concrete classes.
3. **Documentation & Javadoc**: Expand comments to describe concrete subclasses and typical usage patterns.
4. **Testing**: Provide unit tests for construction and serialization behavior.

Overall, the `ProductEvent` class is concise, follows Spring conventions, and serves as a solid foundation for a robust event‑driven product workflow.

package com.salesmanager.core.business.configuration.events.products;

import org.springframework.context.ApplicationEvent;

import com.salesmanager.core.model.catalog.product.Product;

public abstract class ProductEvent extends ApplicationEvent {
	
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	private Product product;
	
	public ProductEvent(Object source, Product product) {
		super(source);
		this.product = product;
	}


	public Product getProduct() {
		return product;
	}

}
