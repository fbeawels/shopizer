# DeleteProductImageEvent.java

## Review

## 1. Summary
The **`DeleteProductImageEvent`** class is a lightweight, immutable event object that is fired when a `ProductImage` is removed from a `Product`.  
- **Purpose:** Notify interested listeners (e.g., listeners that clean up file storage, update search indexes, or invalidate caches) that an image has been deleted.  
- **Key Components:**
  - `ProductImage productImage` – the image that was removed.  
  - `Product product` – the owning product (inherited from `ProductEvent`).  
- **Design Pattern:** Implements the **Observer/Publish‑Subscribe** pattern via Spring’s `ApplicationEvent` infrastructure (assumed from the naming convention).  
- **Frameworks:** Relies on Spring’s event‑publishing mechanism and on the core domain model (`Product`, `ProductImage`).  

## 2. Detailed Description
1. **Inheritance** – `DeleteProductImageEvent` extends `ProductEvent`, which in turn extends `ApplicationEvent`. This gives it all the usual event semantics (source, publisher, etc.).  
2. **Construction** – The constructor receives three parameters:  
   - `Object source` – the object that is publishing the event.  
   - `ProductImage productImage` – the image being deleted.  
   - `Product product` – the product to which the image belonged.  
   It forwards the `source` and `product` to `ProductEvent` and stores the image locally.  
3. **Runtime Behavior** – Once constructed, the event is typically passed to an `ApplicationEventPublisher`. Listeners that implement `ApplicationListener<DeleteProductImageEvent>` will receive the event and react accordingly.  
4. **Cleanup** – No explicit cleanup logic; the event is a passive data holder. The garbage collector handles the object once all references are released.

**Assumptions & Constraints:**
- The event is only meaningful when `productImage` and `product` are non‑null; however, the class does not enforce this.  
- The surrounding codebase must have a listener infrastructure that knows how to interpret this event.  
- Because the class is serializable (via the parent), it can be transmitted across process boundaries if needed.

## 3. Functions/Methods
| Method | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Side‑Effects |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
| `public DeleteProductImageEvent(Object source, ProductImage productImage, Product product)` | Constructor that initializes the event. | `source`, `productImage`, `product` | New event instance | None (except for storing values) |
| `public ProductImage getProductImage()` | Getter for the image that was deleted. | None | `ProductImage` instance | None |

*Reusability:*  
- The class is a simple DTO, so it can be reused across different modules that need to react to image deletion.

## 4. Dependencies
| Dependency | Nature | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.catalog.product.Product` | Domain entity | Core business object. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.catalog.product.image.ProductImage` | Domain entity | Core business object. |
| `ProductEvent` (parent) | Inherited class | Likely extends Spring’s `ApplicationEvent`. |
| Spring Framework (ApplicationEvent, ApplicationEventPublisher) | Third‑party | Handles event publication. |

All dependencies are part of the **SalesManager** project or standard Spring libraries, with no platform‑specific requirements.

## 5. Additional Notes & Recommendations
### Edge Cases
- **Null values**: The constructor does not validate that `productImage` or `product` are non‑null. If either is null, listeners might encounter `NullPointerException`. Consider adding defensive checks or documenting the contract clearly.
- **Immutability**: The class exposes only getters, which is good. However, if `ProductImage` or `Product` are mutable, callers could still alter the state after the event is published. Deep copies or immutable wrappers could mitigate this risk.

### Enhancements
1. **Javadoc & Naming**  
   - Add class‑level Javadoc explaining its role and typical usage.  
   - Document the `source` parameter more explicitly (e.g., “the object that is publishing the event”).  

2. **Utility Methods**  
   - Override `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()` to aid debugging and logging.  
   - A static factory method (e.g., `of(...)`) could improve readability.

3. **Validation**  
   - Throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if `productImage` or `product` is null to enforce correctness early.

4. **Serialization Version**  
   - If the event structure changes in the future, consider updating `serialVersionUID` accordingly.

5. **Event Bus Configuration**  
   - Ensure that the Spring event publisher is configured to publish events to the correct listeners, especially if the application uses multiple contexts.

### Future Extensions
- **Additional Context** – If listeners need more information (e.g., user who performed the deletion, timestamp), consider adding optional fields.  
- **Batch Deletion** – A similar event could be created for bulk image deletions, aggregating multiple `ProductImage` instances.

Overall, the class is concise and functional within an event‑driven architecture. Addressing the small omissions above would increase robustness and maintainability.

```java
package com.salesmanager.core.business.configuration.events.products;

import com.salesmanager.core.model.catalog.product.Product;
import com.salesmanager.core.model.catalog.product.image.ProductImage;

public class DeleteProductImageEvent extends ProductEvent {
	
	
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	private ProductImage productImage;

	public ProductImage getProductImage() {
		return productImage;
	}

	public DeleteProductImageEvent(Object source, ProductImage productImage, Product product) {
		super(source, product);
		this.productImage = productImage;

	}


}
