# CustomerService.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  

**Purpose**  
`CustomerService` is a contract for customer‑related business logic in the SalesManager e‑commerce platform. It defines operations for retrieving, persisting, and querying customers, as well as a few convenience methods (e.g., address lookup from an IP and password‑reset token resolution).  

**Key Components**  

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `CustomerService` | Interface declaring all public customer operations. |
| `SalesManagerEntityService<Long, Customer>` | Generic CRUD service that `CustomerService` extends, guaranteeing standard persistence methods (find, delete, etc.). |
| Domain models (`Customer`, `CustomerCriteria`, `CustomerList`, `Address`, `MerchantStore`) | Plain Java objects that represent the business entities involved. |

**Notable Design Patterns / Libraries**  
- *Repository / Service pattern*: The interface represents the service layer, while a concrete implementation would likely delegate persistence to a repository/DAO.  
- *Generic inheritance*: Extending `SalesManagerEntityService` reduces boilerplate and enforces a common contract across entities.  
- *Use of Java Generics*: The generic `<Long, Customer>` types ensure type safety for entity identifiers and payloads.

## 2. Detailed Description  

### Core Flow  

1. **Initialization** – The framework (e.g., Spring) injects an implementation of `CustomerService` into consuming beans.  
2. **Runtime** – Consumers invoke the defined methods to perform business logic.  
   - Retrieval methods (`getByName`, `getListByStore`, `getByNick`, …) query the data store.  
   - Persistence method `saveOrUpdate` writes or updates customer data.  
   - Utility methods (`getCustomerAddress`, `getByPasswordResetToken`) provide cross‑cutting concerns such as geolocation and security.  
3. **Cleanup** – As an interface, there is no lifecycle logic; the concrete implementation will handle any required resource cleanup.  

### Assumptions & Constraints  

| Assumption | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| `MerchantStore` uniquely identifies a store via code or ID. | Methods that take `MerchantStore` rely on the store’s uniqueness. |
| `CustomerCriteria` contains pagination & filtering info. | The `getListByStore` method that accepts a criteria expects it to be non‑null and well‑formed. |
| The underlying persistence layer supports transactional boundaries. | `saveOrUpdate` is expected to be atomic. |
| IP addresses can be mapped to a country/state via a GeoLocation module. | `getCustomerAddress` may throw `ServiceException` if the module fails. |

### Architectural Notes  

- **Interface‑First**: By exposing only the interface, the design supports multiple implementations (e.g., JPA, JDBC, mock for tests).  
- **Extensibility**: Adding new customer operations only requires updating the interface and implementation, keeping the contract explicit.  
- **Potential Coupling**: Some methods mix concerns (e.g., `getCustomerAddress` ties geolocation to the customer service), which may be refactored into a dedicated address/geo service for cleaner separation.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Returns | Throws | Side Effects |
|--------|---------|------------|---------|--------|--------------|
| `List<Customer> getByName(String firstName)` | Fetches customers by first name (case‑insensitive? implementation‑defined). | `firstName` | List of matching customers | None | None |
| `List<Customer> getListByStore(MerchantStore store)` | Returns all customers belonging to a specific store. | `store` | List of customers | None | None |
| `Customer getByNick(String nick)` | Retrieves a customer by a unique nickname across all stores. | `nick` | Customer | None | None |
| `void saveOrUpdate(Customer customer)` | Persists a new or existing customer; decides between insert or update. | `customer` | None | `ServiceException` if persistence fails | May alter the database |
| `CustomerList getListByStore(MerchantStore store, CustomerCriteria criteria)` | Returns a paginated/filtered list of customers for a store. | `store`, `criteria` | `CustomerList` (contains list + pagination metadata) | None | None |
| `Customer getByNick(String nick, int storeId)` | Same as `getByNick(String)` but scoped to a particular store ID. | `nick`, `storeId` | Customer | None | None |
| `Customer getByNick(String nick, String code)` | Same as above but uses store code instead of ID. | `nick`, `code` | Customer | None | None |
| `Customer getByPasswordResetToken(String storeCode, String token)` | Looks up a customer using a password‑reset token for a specific store. | `storeCode`, `token` | Customer | None | None |
| `Address getCustomerAddress(MerchantStore store, String ipAddress)` | Resolves a geolocated address from an IP via the GeoLocation module. | `store`, `ipAddress` | `Address` | `ServiceException` | None |

**Reusable / Utility Methods**  
- The three `getByNick` overloads provide flexible lookup strategies; they can be refactored into a single method that accepts a `StoreIdentifier` type to reduce duplication.

## 4. Dependencies  

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `SalesManagerEntityService<Long, Customer>` | Third‑party / internal | Provides generic CRUD operations. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.common.Address` | Internal | Represents a physical address. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.customer.*` | Internal | Domain models for customer data. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.merchant.MerchantStore` | Internal | Store context. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.business.exception.ServiceException` | Internal | Custom runtime exception for service layer errors. |

- All dependencies are internal to the SalesManager codebase; no external frameworks (e.g., Spring, Hibernate) are declared directly in this interface.  
- The actual persistence/geo module is abstracted away, which is beneficial for unit testing.

## 5. Additional Notes  

### Edge Cases & Missing Handling  

1. **Overloaded `getByNick`** – The three overloads can cause confusion if a nickname overlaps with a store ID or code. A more explicit API (e.g., `getByNick(String nick, StoreIdentifier)` where `StoreIdentifier` can be ID or code) would reduce ambiguity.  
2. **Null / Empty Parameters** – The interface does not document null handling. Implementations should validate inputs and throw meaningful exceptions.  
3. **Case Sensitivity** – It’s unclear whether nickname or name queries are case‑insensitive. Explicit documentation would help consumers.  
4. **Pagination Limits** – `CustomerCriteria` likely contains pagination; implementations should enforce limits to avoid excessive data loads.  
5. **GeoLocation Failure** – `getCustomerAddress` throws `ServiceException`; consumers need to handle potential failures (e.g., fallback address).  

### Potential Enhancements  

- **Add Search by Email / Phone** – Many applications need to retrieve customers by email or phone number.  
- **Batch Operations** – `saveOrUpdate` could accept a collection for bulk persistence.  
- **Caching** – Frequently accessed customers (e.g., by nickname) could be cached to reduce DB hits.  
- **Audit Trail** – Methods could accept a `UserContext` to record who performed actions.  
- **Method Naming Consistency** – Align with Java bean naming (`findBy...`, `listBy...`, `createOrUpdate...`).  

### Suggested Documentation Improvements  

- Provide Javadoc for every method, including parameter expectations, return contract, and exception scenarios.  
- Add a class‑level Javadoc explaining the role of the service, its transactional guarantees, and typical usage patterns.  

Overall, the interface defines a clean, domain‑focused contract for customer operations. The primary improvements revolve around clarity, consistency, and robust error handling, which will make the service easier to implement and consume.
