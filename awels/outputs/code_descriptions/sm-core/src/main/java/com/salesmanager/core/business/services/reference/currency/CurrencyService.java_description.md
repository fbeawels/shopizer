# CurrencyService.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
The `CurrencyService` interface is a tiny, domain‑specific abstraction that defines the contract for currency‑related business logic. It extends a generic `SalesManagerEntityService<Long, Currency>` – a common base interface for CRUD operations on persistent entities – and adds a domain‑specific finder method `getByCode(String)`.  

**Key components**

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `CurrencyService` | Service layer contract for `Currency` entities |
| `SalesManagerEntityService<Long, Currency>` | Generic CRUD contract (likely providing `create`, `update`, `delete`, `findById`, `findAll`, etc.) |
| `getByCode(String)` | Domain‑specific lookup that retrieves a `Currency` by its ISO‑4217 code |

The design follows the *Service‑Layer* pattern common in Spring / JPA‑based applications. No frameworks are directly referenced in this file, but the naming and generic base type strongly imply integration with a persistence framework (e.g., JPA/Hibernate) and a dependency‑injection container (Spring, CDI, etc.).

## 2. Detailed Description  

### Core Components and Interaction  

1. **Generic CRUD Service**  
   `SalesManagerEntityService<Long, Currency>` is assumed to provide standard CRUD operations. By extending it, `CurrencyService` inherits those operations and guarantees that all currencies can be handled generically.

2. **Domain‑Specific Lookup**  
   `CurrencyService#getByCode(String code)` adds a method that is not covered by the generic service. It allows callers to fetch a `Currency` directly by its ISO code (e.g., “USD”, “EUR”) without first retrieving all entities or performing a custom query.

3. **Implementation**  
   Concrete classes (e.g., `CurrencyServiceImpl`) would implement this interface, delegating generic CRUD calls to a repository/DAO and providing a custom query for the code lookup. The interface decouples the rest of the application from the persistence layer.

### Execution Flow  

- **Initialization** – When the application context is built (e.g., Spring Boot), a concrete implementation is instantiated and injected wherever `CurrencyService` is required.
- **Runtime** – Clients call methods like `findById(id)` (from the base interface) or `getByCode(code)` to fetch or manipulate currencies.
- **Cleanup** – No explicit cleanup is required; the service is stateless, relying on container‑managed resources.

### Assumptions & Constraints  

- **Single Instance** – The service is expected to be stateless and can be a singleton within the DI container.
- **Currency Uniqueness** – `getByCode` assumes that currency codes are unique keys in the database; otherwise the implementation must handle multiple matches.
- **Exception Handling** – The interface does not declare checked exceptions; implementations are free to throw runtime exceptions (e.g., `EntityNotFoundException`) or wrap them in custom domain exceptions.

### Architecture  

The interface adheres to a *clean architecture* approach:  
- **Domain layer** defines the business contract.  
- **Application layer** would implement the interface.  
- **Infrastructure layer** provides the persistence (JPA repository) and any external integrations.  

This separation facilitates testing, swap‑out of persistence providers, and clear responsibility boundaries.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Returns | Side Effects |
|--------|---------|------------|---------|--------------|
| `Currency getByCode(String code)` | Retrieves a `Currency` entity that matches the supplied ISO‑4217 code. | `code` – ISO currency code (e.g., “USD”). | `Currency` instance or `null`/exception if not found. | None (read‑only). |
| *(Inherited from `SalesManagerEntityService`)* | – | – | – | Provides `create`, `update`, `delete`, `findById`, `findAll`, etc. |

**Utility / Reusable Methods**  
While this interface contains only one custom method, the inherited CRUD methods from `SalesManagerEntityService` are reusable across all entity services in the application.

## 4. Dependencies  

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `com.salesmanager.core.business.services.common.generic.SalesManagerEntityService` | **Internal / Base** | Provides generic CRUD operations. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.reference.currency.Currency` | **Domain Model** | Entity representing a currency. |
| Java standard library | **Standard** | No external libraries referenced directly. |

Although no third‑party libraries appear in this file, the typical implementation would rely on:
- **Spring Framework** – for dependency injection, transaction management, and repository support.
- **JPA/Hibernate** – for persistence of the `Currency` entity.

---

## 5. Additional Notes  

### Edge Cases & Robustness  

- **Case Sensitivity** – Implementations should decide whether `getByCode` is case‑sensitive; ISO codes are usually uppercase, but users may input lowercase values.
- **Missing Currency** – Returning `null` versus throwing an exception is a design choice. A clearer contract (e.g., `Optional<Currency>`) could avoid `NullPointerException` pitfalls.
- **Concurrency** – As the service is stateless, concurrent reads are safe. If writes occur concurrently (e.g., two threads attempting to create a currency with the same code), the underlying persistence layer must enforce uniqueness constraints.

### Documentation & Clarity  

- Adding Javadoc comments to the interface and its method would improve discoverability for developers, especially regarding the expected behavior and error handling contract.
- Defining a custom exception type (`CurrencyNotFoundException`) could provide more semantic error handling.

### Future Enhancements  

1. **Paging / Filtering** – Extend the base service to support pagination or filtering by additional attributes (e.g., region, status).
2. **Caching** – Introduce a read‑through cache for `Currency` entities, given that currency data changes infrequently.
3. **Internationalization** – Expose localized currency names/labels via additional service methods.
4. **Versioning / Historical Records** – Track currency changes over time (e.g., currency re‑valuations) if the business requires auditability.

---

**Overall Verdict**  
The interface is concise, well‑structured, and adheres to standard service‑layer design principles. Enhancing documentation and considering edge‑case handling would strengthen its robustness, but the current implementation serves as a solid foundation for currency‑related business logic.
