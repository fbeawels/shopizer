# ShippingDistanceProcessorTest.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  

**Purpose**  
This class (`ShippingDistanceProcessorTest`) is a JUnit test skeleton intended to verify the distance‑based shipping logic of the Sales Manager e‑commerce platform. It constructs a `ShippingQuote`, populates a `Delivery` (the customer address) and a `ShippingOrigin` (the warehouse/shipper location), then invokes the `ShippingQuotePrePostProcessModule` to perform pre‑ and post‑processing of shipping quotes, specifically the distance calculation between origin and destination.

**Key Components**  
| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `ShippingQuote` | Holds the shipping quote that will be enriched with distance data |
| `Delivery` | Represents the customer’s address (street, city, zip, country, zone) |
| `ShippingOrigin` | Represents the shipping source address |
| `ShippingQuotePrePostProcessModule` | The integration module that calculates distances and possibly applies rules |
| `Country` / `Zone` | Geographical metadata used for address validation and lookup |
| JUnit `@Ignore` annotations | Disable test execution until the module is ready or dependencies are wired |

**Notable Design Patterns / Frameworks**  
- **Dependency Injection** (`@Inject`): The test relies on a DI framework (likely CDI, Spring, or Guice) to provide the `ShippingQuotePrePostProcessModule`.  
- **Test Isolation**: The test is deliberately ignored; this indicates a work‑in‑progress approach to avoid flaky tests while developing logic.

## 2. Detailed Description  

### 2.1 Execution Flow  

1. **Injection** – The `ShippingQuotePrePostProcessModule` is injected at runtime.  
2. **Test Setup** – A `ShippingQuote` object is instantiated.  
3. **Address Construction** – A `Delivery` object is populated with a full address (street, city, postal code, country ISO code “CA”, zone “QC”).  
4. **Origin Construction** – A `ShippingOrigin` object mirrors the delivery address but represents the source location.  
5. **Processing (commented)** – The call to `prePostProcessShippingQuotes` is commented out. If enabled, the module would:
   - Compute the geographic distance between the origin and delivery coordinates.
   - Populate the `ShippingQuote` with distance‑based information and potentially other shipping rules.  
6. **Output** – The test prints the latitude and longitude of the delivery address (which are `null` unless the module has set them) and, if uncommented, would print the calculated distance from the quote’s metadata.

### 2.2 Assumptions & Constraints  

- **Geocoding**: The test assumes that the module or an underlying service will resolve street addresses to latitude/longitude. Since no geocoding service is invoked in the test, the coordinates remain `null`.  
- **Locale Handling**: The call passes `Locale.CANADA`; the module likely uses this to apply Canadian shipping rules.  
- **DI Environment**: The test is only functional inside a container that supports `@Inject`. Running it as a plain JUnit test will fail unless the DI context is bootstrapped.  
- **Test Ignorance**: The class and the test method are both annotated with `@Ignore`, which means no execution occurs. This is intentional but indicates the code is incomplete or unstable.

### 2.3 Architecture & Design Choices  

- **Separation of Concerns**: Shipping quote creation, address handling, and business logic are decoupled.  
- **Test‑Driven Development**: The test skeleton is set up before the actual logic, a common TDD pattern.  
- **Use of Constants**: The commented code hints at a `Constants.DISTANCE_KEY`, suggesting a key‑value store for quote metadata.  
- **Explicit Zone/Country**: By setting both, the system can perform validation or look up rates by region.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Side Effects |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
| `testDistance()` | Intended to exercise the distance calculation logic. | None (test data is hard‑coded) | Prints coordinates/distance to `stdout` | Modifies the injected `ShippingQuotePrePostProcessModule` (if uncommented) |
| `shippingDecisionTablePreProcessor.prePostProcessShippingQuotes(...)` *(commented)* | Core business method that enriches the `ShippingQuote` with distance and possibly other calculations. | `ShippingQuote`, `delivery`, `origin`, `Locale`, other optional parameters | Updated `ShippingQuote` object | May modify database state, call external services, or update internal caches (unknown from test) |

> **Note:** The test contains no helper methods; all logic is inlined. If the test were expanded, a helper for creating addresses or asserting results would be beneficial.

## 4. Dependencies  

| Library / Framework | Usage | Standard / 3rd‑Party |
|---------------------|-------|----------------------|
| `javax.inject.Inject` | DI of `ShippingQuotePrePostProcessModule` | Java EE / Jakarta (standard) |
| JUnit (`@Ignore`) | Test lifecycle control | Third‑party (JUnit) |
| `com.salesmanager.*` | Core domain model classes (`ShippingQuote`, `Delivery`, etc.) | Third‑party (Sales Manager platform) |
| `Locale` (likely `java.util.Locale`) | Passes Canadian locale | Standard |
| **Uncommented**: `ShippingQuotePrePostProcessModule` | Integration module performing shipping logic | Platform-specific, possibly using rule engines or geocoding services |

No external APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are directly referenced, but the module may depend on them internally.

## 5. Additional Notes  

### 5.1 Edge Cases & Missing Validation  

- **Null Coordinates**: The test prints `delivery.getLatitude()` and `getLongitude()` immediately after constructing the `Delivery`. Without a geocoding step, these values will be `null`, which could cause `NullPointerException` inside the module if not handled.  
- **Invalid Addresses**: The test uses hard‑coded addresses; there is no validation to confirm that the addresses exist or are reachable.  
- **Locale Fallback**: The test passes a locale, but does not handle cases where a locale mismatch might affect rule selection.  
- **Thread Safety**: If the module holds state (e.g., cached distance results), concurrent test runs could interfere.  

### 5.2 Potential Enhancements  

1. **Uncomment & Wire the Processor** – Enable the call to `prePostProcessShippingQuotes` once the DI environment is stable.  
2. **Mock External Services** – Use a mock geocoding service to provide deterministic latitude/longitude values, ensuring reproducible tests.  
3. **Assertions** – Replace `System.out.println` with JUnit assertions (e.g., `assertEquals(expectedDistance, actualDistance)`).  
4. **Parameterization** – Use JUnit `@ParameterizedTest` to test multiple origin/destination pairs.  
5. **Coverage of Business Rules** – Test scenarios for different zones, countries, and locales to verify rule engine behavior.  
6. **Error Handling** – Add tests for missing address components or unsupported locales.  
7. **Logging** – Replace console output with a logger that can be asserted on, or capture logs in the test.  

### 5.3 Future Directions  

- **Integration with Shipping APIs**: If the platform integrates with carriers (UPS, FedEx), extend tests to cover carrier selection logic.  
- **Performance Benchmark**: Measure the time taken for distance calculation over a large dataset.  
- **Continuous Integration**: Add the test to a CI pipeline with a stubbed DI container (e.g., Spring Boot Test) to ensure it runs automatically.  

---

**Conclusion**  
The test skeleton demonstrates a clear intent: to validate the distance‑based shipping logic within the Sales Manager ecosystem. However, as it stands, the test is non‑functional due to commented code, lack of DI bootstrap, and missing external service mocking. Once those gaps are addressed, the test can become a valuable regression guard for shipping distance calculations and related rule processing.
