# SecurityFacade.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  

The `SecurityFacade` interface defines a contract for handling basic security concerns in the **Sales Manager** application. It abstracts the responsibilities of:

1. **Permission retrieval** – fetch a list of readable permissions for a given set of user groups.
2. **Password handling** – validate format, encode/encrypt, and compare passwords (both raw and encoded forms).

### Key components
| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `getPermissions` | Retrieves permissions for user groups. |
| `validateUserPassword` | Checks if a password meets complexity rules. |
| `encodePassword` | Converts a plain text password into a secure hash. |
| `matchPassword` | Compares an encoded password (stored in the database) with a raw password entered by the user. |
| `matchRawPasswords` | Verifies that two raw passwords are identical (e.g., during registration or password change). |

### Design patterns & libraries
- **Facade Pattern** – The interface provides a simplified façade over more complex underlying security mechanisms (e.g., password encoders, permission services).
- The code itself is framework‑agnostic; the actual implementations will likely depend on Spring Security or similar libraries.

## 2. Detailed Description  

### Core responsibilities
1. **Permission logic** – `getPermissions` accepts a list of group names and is expected to return a collection of `ReadablePermission` objects. The interface does not dictate how permissions are stored or retrieved (database, LDAP, etc.), leaving that to the implementation.
2. **Password validation** – `validateUserPassword` enforces password policies (length, character types, etc.) without specifying the policy; the implementation decides the exact rules.
3. **Password encoding** – `encodePassword` must return a secure hash (e.g., BCrypt). The contract does not require the hash algorithm, but any implementation should use a one‑way hashing function.
4. **Password comparison** –  
   * `matchPassword` compares an encoded (stored) password against a new raw password; the implementation will call the same encoder used in `encodePassword`.  
   * `matchRawPasswords` simply checks that two raw strings are equal, useful for “repeat password” validations.

### Execution flow (typical usage)
1. **User registration** – The client calls `validateUserPassword` → if true, `matchRawPasswords` verifies the user typed the same password twice.  
2. **Password change** – `matchPassword` checks that the entered current password matches the stored hash; `validateUserPassword` ensures the new password is strong.  
3. **Permission resolution** – `getPermissions` is invoked whenever the system needs to determine access rights for a user or a group of users.

### Assumptions & constraints
- Implementations must be **thread‑safe** if used in a concurrent web environment.
- Password encoding and comparison should be performed using a **cryptographically secure** algorithm (e.g., BCrypt, Argon2).
- The interface assumes that the caller knows whether the provided `modelPassword` is encoded or raw; documentation clarifies that `modelPassword` is expected to be encoded.
- No exception handling is defined; implementations can throw unchecked exceptions for validation failures.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Signature | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Side‑effects |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
| `List<ReadablePermission> getPermissions(List<String> groups)` | Retrieves readable permissions for the supplied groups. | Permission resolution | `groups` – list of group names | List of `ReadablePermission` objects | None (pure read operation) |
| `boolean validateUserPassword(String password)` | Validates password format against policy. | Enforce complexity rules | `password` – raw password | `true` if policy satisfied | None |
| `String encodePassword(String password)` | Encodes raw password into a secure hash. | Secure storage | `password` – raw password | Encoded hash string | None |
| `boolean matchPassword(String modelPassword, String newPassword)` | Compares an encoded password with a raw one. | Authentication or password change | `modelPassword` – stored hash; `newPassword` – raw input | `true` if they match | None |
| `boolean matchRawPasswords(String password, String repeatPassword)` | Checks equality of two raw passwords. | Password confirmation | `password`, `repeatPassword` – raw strings | `true` if equal | None |

### Reusable utilities
Although the interface does not provide concrete implementations, it encourages the creation of reusable utilities such as:
- A **PasswordValidator** class encapsulating the policy logic.
- A **PasswordEncoder** wrapper (delegating to Spring’s `PasswordEncoder` or Bcrypt).

## 4. Dependencies  

| Dependency | Type | Remarks |
|------------|------|---------|
| `com.salesmanager.shop.model.security.ReadablePermission` | Project‑specific | Domain model representing a permission that can be exposed to the UI. |
| Java Collections (`java.util.List`) | Standard | Core Java library. |

No third‑party libraries are directly referenced in the interface. Implementations are free to use:

- Spring Security (`PasswordEncoder`, `BCryptPasswordEncoder`, etc.)
- Apache Commons (`StringUtils` for validation)
- Any other cryptographic libraries (e.g., Bouncy Castle).

---

## 5. Additional Notes  

### Edge Cases & Potential Issues  
| Scenario | Risk | Mitigation |
|----------|------|------------|
| **Empty or null group list** | Could return an empty permission list or throw `NullPointerException`. | Validate input and return an empty list or throw a meaningful exception. |
| **Null password arguments** | `NullPointerException` during validation or encoding. | Enforce non‑null checks; throw `IllegalArgumentException` with clear message. |
| **Encoding algorithm mismatch** | `matchPassword` may fail if the encoding algorithm differs from `encodePassword`. | Ensure that both methods use the same encoder instance or configuration. |
| **Performance** | Repeated password validation/encoding in high‑traffic scenarios may become a bottleneck. | Cache policy checks; use efficient hash algorithms (BCrypt with appropriate strength). |

### Future Enhancements  
1. **Policy Configuration** – Add a method to expose the current password policy or allow dynamic updates.  
2. **Audit Logging** – Include hooks for logging password change attempts or permission retrieval for security audits.  
3. **Bulk Permission Retrieval** – Extend `getPermissions` to accept a set of users/groups and return a map of user to permissions.  
4. **Internationalization** – Return validation messages in a localized format rather than just boolean flags.  
5. **Reactive/Asynchronous Support** – Provide `CompletableFuture`/`Mono` variants for non‑blocking usage in reactive frameworks.

### Overall Assessment  
The interface is concise, clearly defines its responsibilities, and follows good separation of concerns. Its design enables different security back‑ends to be swapped behind a common façade, which is valuable for maintainability and testing. Implementations should pay careful attention to thread safety, security best practices for password handling, and proper error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information.

```java
package com.salesmanager.shop.store.controller.security.facade;

import java.util.List;
import com.salesmanager.shop.model.security.ReadablePermission;

  List<ReadablePermission> getPermissions(List<String> groups);
  
  /**
   * Validates password format
   * @param password

  public boolean validateUserPassword(final String password);
  
  /**
   * Encode clear password
   * @param password
   * @return

  public String encodePassword(final String password);

  /**
   * Validate if both passwords match
   * @param modelPassword (should be encrypted)
   * @param newPassword (should be clear)
   * @return

  public boolean matchPassword(String modelPassword, String newPassword);
  
  /**
   *
