# LanguageFacadeImpl.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
The `LanguageFacadeImpl` class is a Spring‐managed service that acts as a façade over the `LanguageService`. Its sole responsibility is to expose a read‑only list of available languages to higher layers (e.g., controllers or REST APIs).  
* **Key components**  
  * `LanguageService` – the underlying business service that retrieves languages from the persistence layer.  
  * `LanguageFacade` – the interface this class implements.  
  * Two custom exceptions: `ResourceNotFoundException` (checked) and `ServiceRuntimeException` (unchecked) to signal application‑level errors.  
* **Frameworks & Libraries**  
  * Spring Framework (`@Service`, dependency injection)  
  * Java EE injection (`@Inject`) – though Spring’s `@Autowired` would be more idiomatic.  
  * Custom `salesmanager` packages for domain models and exception types.  

## 2. Detailed Description  
The class is designed as a thin wrapper that delegates the actual data retrieval to `LanguageService`. The execution flow is:

1. **Invocation** – A consumer calls `getLanguages()` on the façade.  
2. **Delegation** – The method invokes `languageService.getLanguages()` inside a try‑catch block.  
3. **Empty‑List Guard** – If the returned list is empty, a `ResourceNotFoundException` is thrown, signalling that no languages are available.  
4. **Exception Translation** – Any `ServiceException` from the underlying service is caught and re‑thrown as a `ServiceRuntimeException`, converting a checked exception into an unchecked one suitable for Spring’s transaction handling.  
5. **Return** – On success, the list of `Language` objects is returned unchanged.

There is no explicit cleanup logic because the service is stateless; all resources are managed by Spring and the underlying persistence framework.

### Assumptions & Constraints  
* `LanguageService#getLanguages()` is assumed to be thread‑safe and idempotent.  
* The façade treats an empty result set as an error; callers must handle `ResourceNotFoundException`.  
* The `@Inject` annotation relies on a CDI or Spring injection environment; using `@Autowired` might be clearer in a pure Spring context.  

### Architecture & Design Choices  
* **Facade Pattern** – Provides a simplified API for retrieving languages while hiding the complexities of the underlying service layer.  
* **Exception Translation** – Converts checked exceptions to runtime ones, which is common in Spring applications for transaction rollback.  
* **Stateless Service** – Allows Spring to pool instances and maintain high throughput.  

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Signature | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Side Effects |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
| `getLanguages()` | `public List<Language> getLanguages()` | Retrieves the full list of languages. | None | `List<Language>` – non‑empty list of languages. | Throws `ResourceNotFoundException` if the list is empty; throws `ServiceRuntimeException` if `LanguageService` throws `ServiceException`. |

### Reusable / Utility Methods  
The class does not expose any additional reusable helpers; it is intentionally minimal.

## 4. Dependencies  

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `org.springframework.stereotype.Service` | Spring Core | Marks the class as a Spring bean. |
| `javax.inject.Inject` | CDI / Javax | Used for dependency injection; Spring can also inject via `@Autowired`. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.business.services.reference.language.LanguageService` | Custom | Business service for language data. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.reference.language.Language` | Custom | Domain entity representing a language. |
| `com.salesmanager.shop.store.api.exception.ResourceNotFoundException` | Custom | Checked exception signifying missing resources. |
| `com.salesmanager.shop.store.api.exception.ServiceRuntimeException` | Custom | Unchecked wrapper for service exceptions. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.business.exception.ServiceException` | Custom | Checked exception from the business layer. |

All dependencies are internal to the `salesmanager` codebase, except for Spring and Javax injection.

## 5. Additional Notes  

### Edge Cases  
* **Empty List as a Business Condition** – Treating an empty list as an error might not be appropriate for all consumers. Some callers may legitimately expect no languages; consider returning an empty list instead of throwing.  
* **Null List** – If `languageService.getLanguages()` ever returns `null`, a `NullPointerException` will be thrown. Adding a null‑check would make the façade more robust.  

### Potential Enhancements  
1. **Return Optional** – Wrap the result in `Optional<List<Language>>` or use a dedicated DTO to convey “no data” without exceptions.  
2. **Logging** – Add diagnostic logging before throwing exceptions to aid troubleshooting.  
3. **Cache** – Languages are unlikely to change frequently; consider caching the result to reduce service calls.  
4. **Method Overloads** – Provide pagination or filtering capabilities if the language set grows large.  
5. **Switch to `@Autowired`** – For consistency with the rest of the Spring stack and clearer semantics.  

Overall, the class is concise and fulfills its role, but some defensive programming and API design choices could improve its robustness and flexibility.
