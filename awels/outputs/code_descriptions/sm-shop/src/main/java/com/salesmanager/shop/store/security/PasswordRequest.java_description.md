# PasswordRequest.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  
The `PasswordRequest` class is a simple Data‑Transfer Object (DTO) used in the **SalesManager** shop application to carry password‑change data from the client to the server.  
* **Purpose:** Represents a request that contains the user’s *current* password and the *new* password (re‑entered for confirmation).  
* **Key components:**  
  * Two `String` fields – `current` and `repeatPassword`.  
  * Bean‑validation annotations (`@NotEmpty`) to enforce non‑empty values.  
  * Getters and setters for both fields.  
  * Inherits from `AuthenticationRequest`, presumably a base DTO that already implements `Serializable` and may contain authentication‑related metadata.  
* **Design patterns / frameworks:** Uses Java Bean Validation (JSR‑380) for declarative validation. No complex patterns or external frameworks are directly invoked.

---

## 2. Detailed Description  
The class is used as follows:

1. **Initialization** – When a user submits a password‑change form, the payload is mapped to this object (e.g., via Spring MVC’s `@RequestBody`).  
2. **Validation** – The `@NotEmpty` constraints trigger automatically during the data‑binding phase. If either field is missing or empty, the request is rejected with a validation error.  
3. **Runtime behavior** – The service layer receives the fully‑populated DTO and typically:
   * Verifies that `current` matches the stored password for the authenticated user.  
   * Checks that `repeatPassword` matches the desired new password (not shown in this class).  
   * Persists the new password if all checks pass.  
4. **Cleanup** – Since this is a plain DTO, no special cleanup is required. The object is discarded after the request is processed.

### Assumptions & Constraints  
* The parent class `AuthenticationRequest` supplies common fields (e.g., `username`) and implements `Serializable`.  
* Validation is limited to non‑emptiness; any further password policy checks are performed elsewhere.  
* The field `repeatPassword` is assumed to hold the *new* password rather than a repeat of the *current* one, which can be confusing from a naming standpoint.

### Architectural Choice  
A DTO approach keeps the web layer decoupled from domain entities. The minimalistic design adheres to the *plain old Java object* (POJO) style favored in many Spring Boot applications.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Return | Side Effects |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|--------------|
| `getCurrent()` | Accessor for the current password | – | `String` | None |
| `setCurrent(String current)` | Mutator for the current password | `current` – new value | void | None |
| `getRepeatPassword()` | Accessor for the new password (re‑entered) | – | `String` | None |
| `setRepeatPassword(String repeatPassword)` | Mutator for the new password | `repeatPassword` – new value | void | None |

All methods are simple getters/setters. No reusable utilities or business logic are present in this class.

---

## 4. Dependencies  

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `javax.validation.constraints.NotEmpty` | Third‑party (Bean Validation API) | Ensures fields are not `null` or empty. |
| `AuthenticationRequest` (local) | Parent class | Likely implements `Serializable`. |
| Standard Java library (`Serializable`, etc.) | Standard | Required for DTO serialization. |

No framework‑specific annotations (e.g., `@Component`, `@Entity`) are used; the class is a plain DTO.

## 5. Additional Notes  

### Edge Cases & Potential Issues  
1. **Field Naming** – `repeatPassword` implies a confirmation of the *current* password rather than the *new* password. Renaming it to `newPassword` or `confirmedPassword` would clarify intent.  
2. **Password Exposure** – As the DTO is exposed over the network, ensure that the surrounding transport layer (HTTPS) encrypts the payload.  
3. **`toString`/Logging** – The class inherits `toString()` from `Object`, which will print raw passwords if accidentally logged. Consider overriding `toString()` to omit sensitive fields or use a logging framework that redacts them.  
4. **Serialization Version** – `serialVersionUID = 1L` is hard‑coded; if the class evolves (fields added/removed), this ID should be updated to avoid `InvalidClassException`.  
5. **Validation Coverage** – Only non‑emptiness is checked here. Additional constraints (e.g., `@Size`, custom password strength validators) should be applied in the service layer or via a dedicated validator.

### Future Enhancements  
- **Custom Validator** – Add a class‑level validator that checks that `current` and `repeatPassword` are distinct or that they match a password policy.  
- **Security Auditing** – Store a timestamp or audit trail when the password change request is received.  
- **Localization** – The validation messages (`{message.password.required}`) assume a resource bundle; ensure it exists for all supported locales.  
- **DTO Immutability** – Make the class immutable (private final fields, constructor injection) to avoid accidental mutation after creation.  
- **Unit Tests** – Add tests to confirm that validation constraints fire correctly and that the DTO serializes/deserializes as expected.

In summary, the class is functional and concise but would benefit from clearer naming, enhanced security safeguards, and a more robust validation strategy.

```java
package com.salesmanager.shop.store.security;

import javax.validation.constraints.NotEmpty;

public class PasswordRequest extends AuthenticationRequest {

  /**
   * 
   */
  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  @NotEmpty(message = "{message.password.required}")
  private String current;
  
  @NotEmpty(message = "{message.password.required}")
  private String repeatPassword;

  public String getCurrent() {
    return current;
  }

  public void setCurrent(String current) {
    this.current = current;
  }

  public String getRepeatPassword() {
    return repeatPassword;
  }

  public void setRepeatPassword(String repeatPassword) {
    this.repeatPassword = repeatPassword;
  }

}
