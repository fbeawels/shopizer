# ZoneFacade.java

## Review

## 1. Summary

**Purpose & Functionality**  
The `ZoneFacade` interface defines a contract for retrieving a list of `ReadableZone` objects filtered by a country code, language, and merchant store context. It is intended to be implemented by a service that abstracts the data‑access and business logic for zone lookups, making it easier for controllers or other layers to obtain zone information without concerning themselves with persistence details.

**Key Components**  
- `getZones(String countryCode, Language language, MerchantStore merchantStore)` – the sole method, returning a list of zones that belong to the specified country and are localized using the provided language, scoped to the given merchant store.  
- Domain models:  
  - `MerchantStore` – represents the merchant context.  
  - `Language` – encapsulates language information for i18n.  
  - `Zone` – the core entity (not directly exposed).  
  - `ReadableZone` – a DTO used for read‑only representation of zone data to the client.  

**Design Patterns / Frameworks**  
- **Facade Pattern** – the interface hides complex subsystem interactions behind a simplified method.  
- **Dependency Inversion** – callers depend on this abstraction rather than concrete implementations.  
- **DTO Pattern** – `ReadableZone` acts as a data transfer object to decouple internal entities from external representations.  
- The code follows standard Java conventions and leverages the domain model from the `com.salesmanager.core` package.

## 2. Detailed Description

### Core Components & Interaction
1. **Facade Interface (`ZoneFacade`)**  
   - Declares a single method for retrieving zones.  
   - Acts as the boundary between higher‑level application layers (e.g., controllers, services) and the underlying zone repository or business service.  

2. **Supporting Domain Objects**  
   - **`MerchantStore`**: Provides context such as store ID, locale, and possibly multi‑store support.  
   - **`Language`**: Determines the language code to localize zone names or descriptions.  
   - **`Zone`**: The persisted entity representing a geographical or administrative region.  
   - **`ReadableZone`**: A lightweight, immutable DTO that is returned to the caller, typically containing only the fields needed for display or API responses.  

### Flow of Execution (Typical Implementation Scenario)
1. **Controller Layer**  
   - Receives an HTTP request specifying a country code, language (often derived from the `Accept-Language` header), and merchant store (possibly from the session or security context).  
   - Calls `zoneFacade.getZones(...)`.  

2. **Facade Implementation**  
   - Delegates to a service/repository layer that queries the database for `Zone` entities matching the country code and merchant store.  
   - Transforms each `Zone` into a `ReadableZone` (via a mapper or constructor).  
   - Returns the list.  

3. **Presentation Layer**  
   - Serializes the `ReadableZone` list to JSON/XML for the response.  

### Assumptions & Constraints
- **Country Code** is expected to be a valid ISO 3166‑1 alpha‑2 string.  
- **Language** must be present and supported by the system; otherwise a default fallback might be applied.  
- **MerchantStore** must be non‑null and represent an active store; its ID is used for scoping.  
- The method is read‑only; it does not mutate any state.  

### Architecture & Design Choices
- **Single Responsibility**: The interface focuses solely on retrieving zones, keeping concerns isolated.  
- **Extensibility**: New methods can be added (e.g., filtering by zone type) without affecting existing implementations.  
- **Testability**: Unit tests can mock `ZoneFacade` easily, enabling isolated testing of controllers or services.

## 3. Functions/Methods

| Method | Description | Parameters | Returns | Side‑Effects |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------|--------------|
| `List<ReadableZone> getZones(String countryCode, Language language, MerchantStore merchantStore)` | Retrieves zones for a specified country, localized by language, scoped to a merchant store. | `countryCode`: ISO 3166‑1 alpha‑2 code.<br>`language`: language entity for localization.<br>`merchantStore`: store context. | `List<ReadableZone>` – an immutable list of zone DTOs. | None (read‑only). |

### Reusable/Utility Methods
- None defined in this interface; utility methods would typically reside in an implementing class or a separate mapper utility.

## 4. Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.merchant.MerchantStore` | Domain | Core domain model, likely an entity. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.reference.language.Language` | Domain | Represents a language; could include locale metadata. |
| `com.salesmanager.core.model.reference.zone.Zone` | Domain | Internal entity; not exposed to callers. |
| `com.salesmanager.shop.model.references.ReadableZone` | DTO | Read‑only representation for API consumers. |
| Java Standard Library | Standard | `java.util.List`. |

No third‑party libraries or frameworks are referenced directly. The implementation would likely depend on Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, or similar persistence frameworks, but those are not part of this interface.

## 5. Additional Notes

### Edge Cases & Potential Pitfalls
- **Null Arguments**: The method signature does not enforce non‑null constraints. Implementations should validate inputs and throw meaningful exceptions (`IllegalArgumentException` or custom domain exceptions).  
- **Empty Result Set**: Returning an empty list is acceptable, but the contract should document whether `null` is ever returned.  
- **Performance**: If the zone table is large, pagination or streaming might be necessary. The current signature returns all zones in memory.  
- **Caching**: Repeated lookups for the same country/language/merchant combinations could benefit from caching (e.g., Spring Cache).  

### Future Enhancements
- **Pagination**: Add parameters for page number and size (`Pageable` or custom DTO).  
- **Filtering**: Extend with filters such as zone type, active status, or region hierarchy.  
- **Error Handling**: Define a custom exception hierarchy for scenarios like “Country not found” or “Merchant store inactive.”  
- **Async Support**: Return `CompletableFuture<List<ReadableZone>>` or use reactive types (`Flux<ReadableZone>`) for non‑blocking calls.  
- **Documentation**: Provide JavaDoc comments explaining expected behavior, parameter constraints, and possible exceptions.

Overall, the interface is clean, focused, and aligns with good separation of concerns. The real value will come from a robust implementation that addresses validation, performance, and extensibility concerns.
