# OrderApiIntegrationTest.java

## Review

## 1. Summary  

The file defines a **JUnit integration‑test skeleton** for the `Order` API in a Spring‑Boot e‑commerce application.  
Key points:

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `OrderApiIntegrationTest` | Test class extending `ServicesTestSupport` (likely provides shared setup, mock data, etc.) |
| `@Ignore` | JUnit annotation that disables the entire test class. |
| `TestRestTemplate` | Spring’s lightweight `RestTemplate` used to perform HTTP calls against the embedded test server. |
| `sampleCart()` | A helper method (inherited from `ServicesTestSupport`) that builds a sample `ReadableShoppingCart` object. |

No actual test logic is present yet; the class is essentially a placeholder awaiting real implementation.

---

## 2. Detailed Description  

### Overall Architecture  
The project follows a **Spring‑Boot** micro‑service architecture, using:

* **Spring MVC** for REST endpoints (not shown here).  
* **Spring‑Boot Test** (`spring-boot-starter-test`) for integration tests.  
* **JUnit 5** (implicitly, since `@Ignore` is a JUnit 4 feature; in JUnit 5 the equivalent would be `@Disabled`).  

The test class intends to:

1. **Create a shopping cart** (via `sampleCart()`).  
2. **Post the cart to the `/orders` endpoint** to generate an order.  
3. **Verify** that the response is correct (status, body, etc.).  

However, the current implementation stops after building the cart, leaving the HTTP call and assertions absent.

### Execution Flow  
1. **Spring Test Context** starts up (though the `@SpringBootTest` annotation is missing).  
2. **Dependencies** (`TestRestTemplate`) are injected.  
3. **Method `createOrder`** runs (but is not annotated as a test, so it will never execute).  
4. **No cleanup** is defined—typical for stateless integration tests, but if a cart or order is persisted, a teardown method would be prudent.

### Assumptions & Constraints  
* The project uses an **embedded web server** (likely Tomcat/Jetty) started by the test framework.  
* `ServicesTestSupport` provides domain objects and perhaps user authentication utilities.  
* The application’s order API expects a `ReadableShoppingCart` payload; no custom serializers are indicated.

## 3. Functions/Methods  

| Method | Description | Parameters | Return | Side‑Effects |
|--------|-------------|------------|--------|--------------|
| `createOrder()` | Skeleton test method meant to exercise the order creation flow. | none | `void` | None (currently). Intended to invoke the API and perform assertions. |
| (Inherited) `sampleCart()` | Builds a populated `ReadableShoppingCart` instance for testing. | none | `ReadableShoppingCart` | May configure in-memory cart items, customer details, etc. |

**Missing / Required Methods**

* `@Test` annotated method that actually performs the HTTP POST and asserts the response.
* Potential cleanup (`@AfterEach`) if orders are persisted.

---

## 4. Dependencies  

| Library / Framework | Type | Role |
|---------------------|------|------|
| `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test` | Third‑party | Provides JUnit, TestRestTemplate, mock MVC, etc. |
| `org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter` (or JUnit 4) | Third‑party | Test runner. The presence of `@Ignore` suggests JUnit 4. |
| `com.salesmanager.shop.model.shoppingcart.ReadableShoppingCart` | Application | Domain DTO for cart data. |
| `com.salesmanager.test.shop.common.ServicesTestSupport` | Application | Base test class offering shared utilities (e.g., `sampleCart()`). |

No platform‑specific libraries are used beyond Spring Boot’s usual components.

## 5. Additional Notes  

### Edge Cases & Missing Scenarios  
* **Authentication** – If the order API requires an authenticated user, the test must include a valid token or mock security context.  
* **Error handling** – Tests for validation errors (empty cart, invalid items, insufficient stock) are currently absent.  
* **Data isolation** – Without a clean-up strategy, repeated test runs may leave stale orders in the test database.  

### Suggested Enhancements  

1. **Annotate the class properly**  
   ```java
   @SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
   public class OrderApiIntegrationTest extends ServicesTestSupport { … }
   ```

2. **Rename and annotate the test method**  
   ```java
   @Test
   public void shouldCreateOrderWhenValidCartSubmitted() throws Exception {
       ReadableShoppingCart cart = super.sampleCart();
       ResponseEntity<OrderDto> response =
           testRestTemplate.postForEntity("/orders", cart, OrderDto.class);
       assertThat(response.getStatusCode()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.CREATED);
       assertThat(response.getBody()).isNotNull();
   }
   ```

3. **Handle authentication**  
   * Use `TestRestTemplate` with a `RestTemplateCustomizer` that injects a JWT, or set the `Authorization` header manually.

4. **Verify persistence**  
   * After order creation, query the repository (or use `testRestTemplate.getForEntity("/orders/{id}")`) to confirm the order was stored.

5. **Cleanup**  
   * If orders are persisted, delete them in an `@AfterEach` method or use an in‑memory database that resets between tests.

6. **Add negative tests**  
   * Submit an empty cart, or a cart with items that are out of stock, and assert a `400 Bad Request` or appropriate error response.

### Design Observations  

* The current skeleton follows **plain JUnit + Spring‑Boot Test** patterns, which is perfectly fine for integration testing.  
* If the project grows, consider extracting the HTTP call into a dedicated service or `RestClient` helper to keep tests DRY.  
* The use of `TestRestTemplate` is appropriate for functional integration tests; for pure unit tests of the controller, `MockMvc` would be preferable.

---

**Bottom line:** The code is a placeholder; adding the missing annotations, HTTP calls, assertions, and cleanup will turn it into a meaningful integration test. Once completed, it will provide confidence that the order creation workflow behaves correctly in a real application context.

import org.junit.Ignore;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.web.client.TestRestTemplate;

import com.salesmanager.shop.model.shoppingcart.ReadableShoppingCart;
import com.salesmanager.test.shop.common.ServicesTestSupport;


@Ignore
public class OrderApiIntegrationTest extends ServicesTestSupport {
	
    @Autowired
    private TestRestTemplate testRestTemplate;

    public void createOrder() throws Exception {
    	
    	//create cart
    	ReadableShoppingCart cart = super.sampleCart();
    	
    	//create order
    }

}
