# CartTestBean.java

## Review

## 1. Summary
`CartTestBean` is a plain‑old Java object (POJO) that represents a shopping‑cart snapshot used in integration tests for the sales‑manager shop.  
Its primary responsibilities are:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `cartId` | A unique identifier for the cart (e.g. UUID). |
| `products` | A mutable list of `ReadableProduct` objects that belong to the cart. |

The class exposes simple getters and setters, with the setter for `cartId` intentionally package‑private to keep the API limited to the test package. The implementation is straightforward and has no external dependencies beyond the standard Java collections and the `ReadableProduct` domain model.

Design patterns: none. The class is a simple DTO used only for tests.

## 2. Detailed Description
`CartTestBean` is a helper object that holds data for a test scenario. It is instantiated by test code, populated with a cart identifier and a list of products, and then consumed by the test to make assertions about the cart state.

### Flow of execution
1. **Construction** – A new instance is created with the default constructor (implicitly provided by Java).
2. **Mutation** – Test code calls `setCartId(String)` and `setProducts(List<ReadableProduct>)` to populate the instance.
3. **Usage** – The populated bean is passed to test utilities, assertion helpers, or other test components that expect a `CartTestBean`.
4. **Cleanup** – No special cleanup logic is required; the object is discarded after the test finishes.

### Assumptions & Constraints
- The list of products is expected to be non‑null. The default value is an empty `ArrayList`, but `setProducts` accepts any list (including `null` which would replace the internal list).
- `ReadableProduct` is a read‑only representation of a product used in the shop layer; it is assumed to be immutable or at least safe to expose.
- The class is intentionally package‑private for the setter of `cartId` to restrict mutation from outside the test package.

## 3. Functions/Methods
| Method | Signature | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Side‑Effects |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
| `getCartId()` | `public String getCartId()` | Retrieve the cart identifier. | None | The `cartId` string. | None |
| `setCartId(String)` | `void setCartId(String cartId)` | Set the cart identifier. **Package‑private** to limit external mutation. | `String` | None | Updates the internal `cartId`. |
| `getProducts()` | `public List<ReadableProduct> getProducts()` | Retrieve the product list. | None | The internal list reference. | None (returns a direct reference; callers may modify it). |
| `setProducts(List<ReadableProduct>)` | `public void setProducts(List<ReadableProduct> products)` | Replace the product list. | `List<ReadableProduct>` | None | Updates the internal `products` reference. |

**Reusable / Utility Methods** – None; the class is a simple container.

## 4. Dependencies
| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| `java.util.ArrayList` | Standard JDK | Provides a mutable list implementation. |
| `java.util.List` | Standard JDK | Interface used for the product list. |
| `com.salesmanager.shop.model.catalog.product.ReadableProduct` | Third‑party (application domain) | The test data model for products. |

No external libraries or frameworks are required.

## 5. Additional Notes
### Edge Cases & Potential Issues
1. **Null product list** – `setProducts(null)` will set the internal reference to `null`, causing a `NullPointerException` if `getProducts()` is later called. Consider defensive copying or validation.
2. **Mutable list exposure** – `getProducts()` returns the live list, allowing callers to modify it. In a test context this may be acceptable, but it could lead to accidental state changes. Returning an unmodifiable copy (`Collections.unmodifiableList`) could be safer.
3. **Thread‑safety** – The class is not thread‑safe. Tests that run in parallel and share a `CartTestBean` instance could suffer from race conditions. Typically, test beans are not shared, but it’s worth noting.

### Future Enhancements
- **Builder pattern** – Introduce a builder to create immutable test beans more ergonomically.
- **Immutability** – Switch to an immutable list (e.g., `Collections.unmodifiableList`) and make `CartTestBean` itself immutable to avoid accidental mutation.
- **Validation** – Add basic validation in setters (non‑empty `cartId`, non‑null product list) to surface issues early.

Overall, the class serves its purpose in test code: a minimal, readable DTO with no unnecessary complexity.

```java
package com.salesmanager.test.shop.integration.cart;

import com.salesmanager.shop.model.catalog.product.ReadableProduct;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class CartTestBean {

    private String cartId;

    private List<ReadableProduct> products = new ArrayList<>();

    public String getCartId() {
        return cartId;
    }

    void setCartId(String cartId) {
        this.cartId = cartId;
    }

    public void setProducts(List<ReadableProduct> products) {
        this.products = products;
    }

    public List<ReadableProduct> getProducts() {
        return products;
    }
